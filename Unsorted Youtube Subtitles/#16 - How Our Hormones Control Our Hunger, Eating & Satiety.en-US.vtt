00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.930
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.700
where we discuss science

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.822
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:08.405
[gentle music]

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.670
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.770
and I'm a professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.800
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.980
This podcast is separate

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.410
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.450
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.330
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.390
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.580
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.520
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.900
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.220
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.530
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.300
to help you better understand your body

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.730
and help you reach your health goals.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.897
I've long been a fan of
getting blood work done.

00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:47.800
And the simple reason for that,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.010
is that most of the things
that you want to know

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.740
about your health, such as
hormones, metabolic factors,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.520
blood sugar levels, et cetera,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.940
can only be analyzed from blood.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.380
And nowadays there are
also excellent DNA tests

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.570
that can also give you
valuable information

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.210
about what's going on at
the cellar, molecular,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.800
even the neural circuit level
within your brain and body.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.970
InsideTracker makes getting
blood and DNA tests easy.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.900
You can go to a testing site
where they draw your blood,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.100
they take your DNA sample,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.680
or they can come to your
home if you prefer that.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.960
As well, they have a
really amazing dashboard.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.410
The dashboard lets you understand

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.480
what your levels of various hormones

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.350
and metabolic factors et cetera mean,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.707
and what you should do about them.

00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:30.520
And I think that's one of the main things

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.450
that really separates InsideTracker

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.580
apart from other blood and DNA tests.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.940
Most tests you get the results back,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.190
but there are no directives
about what to do specifically

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.270
in order to bring the
numbers into the ranges

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.920
that you would like for your goals.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.070
InsideTracker makes all
of that extremely simple

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.830
and extremely clear.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.330
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.370
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.530

Use the code Huberman at checkout.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.740
That's insidetracker.com/huberman

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.800
any of InsideTrackers plans.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.010
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.650
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.070
vitamin, mineral probiotic drink.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.960
I started taking Athletic
Greens back in 2012

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.110
and I've taken it ever since.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.630
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.640
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.410
and the reason I still take it now,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.530
is that Athletic Greens

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.720
really lets me cover
all my nutritional basis

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.040
in terms of vitamins,
minerals and probiotics.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.280
There's so much data now

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.510
pointing to the fact
that the gut microbiome

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.340
and the gut brain axis is
important for metabolism

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.960
and for endocrine health.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.270
The vitamins, minerals and
probiotics in Athletic Greens

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.120
make me feel confident that
I'm covering all my bases.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.250
I do take other supplements,
but with Athletic Greens

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.420
I know that I've got all the
foundational stuff handled.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.940
It also tastes really good.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.090
Tastes fine on its own,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.700
you can mix it with
water, which is what I do.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.493
I add a little bit of
lemon juice or lime juice,

00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:56.660
because I like a little tartness
flavor in there as well,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.750
but most people just mix it with water,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.210
it mixes up super easily.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.660
I drink it once or twice a day.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.010
Usually once mid morning, and
once again in the afternoon.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.570
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.850
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.430
And if you do that, you can
claim their special offer

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.960
which is a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.210
There is now a ton of
evidence that vitamin D3

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.140
is involved in countless
metabolic processes,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.770
hormonal processes that are important

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.060
for overall health and wellbeing.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.060
Vitamin D3, you can get
from the sun of course,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.050
but most people are
deficient in vitamin D3.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.890
So if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.120
you'll get the Athletic Greens,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.760
you'll get the year's
supply of vitamin D3 and K2

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.370
and you'll get five free travel packs.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.280
So once again it's
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.517
to get Athletic Greens, the vitamin D3K2,

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:49.490
and that's a year supply plus
the five free travel packs.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.840
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Munk Pack.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.520
Munk Pack is a company that
makes keto-friendly snacks

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.900
that taste incredible

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.170
but have just one gram of sugar or less.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.140
And indeed they taste incredible.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.970
In fact, my production team
here at the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.390
teases me because I actually
have to keep the boxes

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.250
of Munk Pack bars in my basement

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.420
'cause otherwise I'll
tear through all of them.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.697
I remember the first time
I tasted it, I was like,

00:04:11.697 --> 00:04:13.290
all right, here we go, a keto bar.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.070
I'm not a big fan of bars in general,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.430
most of them don't taste good to me.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.210
And I tasted the Munk Pack bars,

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.050
and they are absolutely awesome.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.800
They come in a lot of different flavors.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.910
I'm partial to the caramel sea salt one,

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.490
but they also have sea
salt dark chocolate,

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.610
peanut butter dark chocolate.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.890
They have a bunch of flavors.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.890
They're all incredible,
I've tried them all.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.120
Which is why I keep them in my basement.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.520
As I mentioned previously on this podcast,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.620
I'm neither keto nor carbo.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.110
I don't really follow a
particular diet in that sense.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.760
I eat in a way that maximizes my alertness

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.510
and my levels of focus during
the day when I want to work,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.670
and that maximize my
transition to sleep at night.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.470
So, I basically eat low carb
keto-ish during the day.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.090
And I know the ketonistas will
say that I'm not in ketosis

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.940
and I can manage to get into ketosis.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.020
But the main idea,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.330
is I keep my carbohydrates
low during the day.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.380
And then at night I do eat carbohydrates.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.850
So for me, the Munk Pack
bars are a really good snack

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.360
usually in the afternoon,
with a cup of coffee,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.530
especially if I'm going
to train soon after that,

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.350
or if I just want to snack and
I'm going to continue working.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.260
As I mentioned before, they
are absolutely delicious.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.030
They also don't have any of
the stuff that's bad for you.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.540
No soy, trans fat, sugar,
alcohols, artificial colors,

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.970
all that stuff that we
know we should avoid.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.650
If you want to try Munk Pack
bars, you can go to Munk Pack,

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.760

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.220
This month, we're talking
all about hormones.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.280
Hormones are incredible

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.680
and they control so many
processes in the brain and body.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.940
Last episode, we talked about

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.430
the role of estrogen and testosterone.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.480
Today we're going to talk about

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.920
how hormones impact feeding and hunger,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.630
as well as satiety, the feeling
that you don't want to eat

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.790
or that you've eaten enough.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.070
Now, it's important to understand

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.740
that hormones don't work
alone in this context.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.550
Today I'm going to describe some hormones

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.170
that have powerful effects

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.460
on whether or not you
want to eat more or less

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.810
or stop eating altogether.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.860
But they don't do that on their own,

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.830
they do that in cooperation
with the nervous system.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.110
So today, I would say as much

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.730
or perhaps even more
than any other episodes,

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.790
we're going to hear a lot of biology

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.500
but there are multiple what
I'm going to call entry points

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.720
for tools that you can apply

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.780
in order to regulate
your levels of hunger,

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.580
your meal timing, your levels of satiety

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.440
of not wanting to eat more.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.380
And many of this is
actionable with behaviors,

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.420
but of course, we're also
going to talk about supplements

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.760
and we're actually going to talk about

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.220
a little bit of brain
machine interface devices

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.560
that can actually be involved

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.570
in manipulating these incredible things

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.270
that we think of as hunger
and appetite and satiety.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.150
So, the first thing that you need to know

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.860
about the nervous system side,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.230
the neural control,
over-feeding and hunger,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.700
is that there's an area of your brain

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.280
called the hypothalamus.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.310
It's in the forebrain,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.080
which tells you it's in
the front of your brain,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.690
and it's at the base of the forebrain.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.400
Now, the hypothalamus contains

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.930
lots of different kinds of neurons

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.860
doing lots of different kinds of things.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.240
There are neurons in your hypothalamus

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.650
controlling sexual behavior,
controlling body temperature,

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.200
controlling circadian rhythms,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.830
the desire to sleep or be awake.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.970
Even neurons controlling rage.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.140
There are actually neurons that
if we were to stimulate them

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.343
would send you or anyone into a rage.

00:07:29.343 --> 00:07:31.650
They're just powerful control centers

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:32.823
for the brain and body.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.160
There's a particular
area of the hypothalamus

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.080
called the ventromedial hypothalamus.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.520
And it's one that researchers
have been interested

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.500
for a long time now, in
terms of its relationship

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.900
to hunger and feeding.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.510
And the reason is, it creates
these paradoxical effects.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.420
What do I mean by that?

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.010
What they found was that
sometimes lesioning,

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.890
or disrupting the neurons in
the ventromedial hypothalamus

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.240
would make animals or people hyperphasia,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.540
they would want to eat crazy.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.740
And other lesions in other
individuals or animals

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.010
would make them anorexic,

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.810
it would make them not want to eat at all.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.470
It would make food aversive.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.950
So that means that the
ventromedial hypothalamus

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.010
is definitely an
interesting control station

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.910
for hunger and feeding and satiety,

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.950
but it doesn't really
tell you what's going on

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.010
at a deeper level.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.870
In fact, it's a little bit
confusing or paradoxical.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.830
It turns out that there
are multiple populations

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.640
of neurons in there, we're
going to talk about those.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.270
Some are promoting feeding,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.100
and some are promoting
not feeding or not eating.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.590
Now, the other neural
component of all this

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.180
that you need to know about,

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.010
actually has to do with your mouth.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.330
So there's an area of your cortex,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.940
so that's a little bit
further up in your brain,

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.600
called the insular cortex.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.990
And it processes a lot of
different kinds of information.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.430
Mostly information about
what's going on inside you,

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.460
so called the interoception.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.800
The insular cortex has neurons

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.310
that get input from your mouth,

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.430
from the touch receptors in your mouth.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.890
And insular cortex has powerful control

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.550
over whether or not you're
enjoying what you're eating,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.900
whether or not you want to
avoid what you're eating,

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.240
whether or not you had enough,

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.060
or whether or not you want
to continue eating more.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.910
And that has to do, believe it or not,

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.490
with the touch or sensation of eating.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.323
I'm very familiar with this.

00:09:14.323 --> 00:09:16.980
I'm one of these people,
I love eating so much,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.490
that I just like the mere act of chewing.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.760
You know, I like celery sticks enough.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.070
I'm not crazy about them, but
you know they taste fine to me

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.903
and I like chewing on celery sticks,

00:09:24.903 --> 00:09:27.600
but I actually just like chewing on them.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.750
I could eat all day long

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.100
except that it's not healthy to do that.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.260
But the mere act of chewing
for me is very pleasurable.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.860
People who chew gum feel this way as well.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.170
And just as a point about gum or chewing,

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.380
if you choose something like celery

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.940
or cucumber slices or chew gum,

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.270
provided it doesn't have any
sugar or caloric content,

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.980
it's not going to drive increased hunger.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.820
That generally isn't the case.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.150
But if you eat something with
sugar, as we'll find out,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.270
it has a very specific
action in the insular cortex

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.690
and in other areas of your nervous system

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.750
that promotes the desire to eat more.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.060
But the key point right now

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.450
is to know you've got
these two brain areas,

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.110
the ventromedial hypothalamus,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.460
that's involved in hunger
and lack of hunger,

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.970
sort of an accelerator
and a brake on feeding.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.690
And you have this insular cortex

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.080
that gets input from your mouth,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.280
and cares about chewing and
the consistency of foods

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.700
and all sorts of interesting things

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.190
that are just very tactile.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.230
And I think most people think
about the touch receptors on,

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.350
excuse me, the taste
receptors on the tongue.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.950
But we often don't think about

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.250
the touch or tactile essence of food.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.900
And the thing that comes to mind just now

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.760
is I've gone to sushi several times,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.650
and some people really like the urchin.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.500
I don't like the urchin.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.110
There's something about it
that kind of creeps me out

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.040
about the consistency,
other people love it.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.360
So it's highly individual
and it's probably learned,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.820
and there's some probably
cultural background to this

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.480
if you were raised eating urchin.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.490
Some people love that
consistency or that touch.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.700
So touch has a lot to do

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.850
with whether or not
you want to eat or not.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.580
Now, let's get back to the
ventromedial hypothalamus.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.330
Sometimes it makes animals
or people want to eat more,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.370
sometimes less, so what's going on there?

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.690
There's a classic experiment that was done

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.250
in which researchers took two rats,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.790
and so-called parabiosed
them to each other.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.620
What that meant is that
they did a little surgery

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.410
and they linked their blood supply

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.170
so that they were forever
physically linked to one another

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.650
and could exchange factors in the blood,

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.720
but their brains were separate,
their mouths were separate,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.990
and they essentially did
everything separately

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.300
except that they were
linked to one another.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.160
So they had to walk together

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.360
and go to the same
places in order to do it.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.710
This parabiosis experiment

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.750
revealed something really important.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.900
When they lesioned the
ventromedial hypothalamus

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.210
in one of the rats that was
connected to the other rat,

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.430
that rat got very, very
fat, just really obese,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.390
huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.400
The other one however, got very thin,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.960
it actually lost weight,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.720
despite consuming the same
amount of food that it had

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.110
prior to the other one getting the lesion.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.120
So what does this tell us?

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.590
This tells us that there's
something in the blood

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.120
that's being exchanged
between the two animals,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.740
because it was their blood
supply that was linked.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.450
And that tells us that there's
hormone or endocrine signals

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.670
that are involved in the desire to eat,

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.320
and hunger and appetite.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.610
And so next, we're going to talk about

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.540
what those endocrine signals are,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.590
and then I'm going to immediately point

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.650
to some entry points that you can use.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.230
And you can use these

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.810
even if you're not parabiosed to anything.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.880
And that can allow you to
time your meal frequency,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.610
and predict when you're
going to be hungry or not.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.220
As well as a drive up appetite.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.570
Believe it or not, there
are people out there

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.370
who are trying to eat more.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.340
Although I think far many more
people are trying to eat less

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.490
because nowadays, the data
just point to the fact

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.560
that there is essentially
an epidemic of diabetes,

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.490
type II diabetes and obesity.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.110
And most everyone agrees now,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.320
that maintaining a healthy body weight

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.720
and body weight composition,

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.790
is one of the best paths to longevity

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.160
and to just feeling very good

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.410
and actually being able to think.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.570
Cognitive functioning

00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.570
is actually linked to levels
of adipose tissue and so forth.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.050
So, let's talk about the endocrine factors

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.860
that regulate feeding, hunger and satiety.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.190
One of the really
exciting things to emerge

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.630
in the science of feeding and
appetite in the last 20 years,

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.600
is the discovery of another brain area.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.600
And not just the
ventromedial hypothalamus,

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.770
but it's an area of the brain
called the arcuate nucleus.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.920
And the arcuate nucleus

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.890
has some really
fascinating sets of neurons

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.380
that release even more
incredible molecules

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.450
and chemicals into the blood.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.680
And these chemicals act as accelerators

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.940
on feeding and appetite, or breaks.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.340
And the really cool thing

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.320
is that you can actually
control these molecules

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.510
through simple behaviors.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.280
And once you understand
what these molecules are,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.530
you'll start to understand
why that's the case.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.210
And the control points
that you have right now

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.000
in order to control your
appetite in either direction,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.970
increase or decrease.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.070
So, first of all, there are set of neurons

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.950
in this arcuate nucleus
called the PMOC neurons, okay?

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.590
I don't want to get into
what the acronym stands for,

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.030
but I'll do it anyway.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.930
It's the Proopiomelanocortin system, okay?

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.940
So these are PMOC neurons,
Proopiomelanocortin.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.120
And if you heard melano,
that should tell you

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.810
it has something to do with pigmentation

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.660
in skin cells or in hair cells,
pigmentation of some sort,

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.850
because of melanin.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.570
Last episode, I talked a little bit

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.020
about the relationship between
light dopamine and melanin.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.830
So you should already be
thinking, wait, melano means

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.530
it probably has something
to do with that system,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.220
and indeed it does.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.627
Now, the POMC neurons, make
something called Alpha MSH.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.050
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone,

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.170
Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.140
If you don't want to remember
any of the other acronyms

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.920
and terms I've talked
about, this episode so far,

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.860
do try and remember M-S-H, okay?

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.450
Mouse, Sam, Hamster, M-S-H, okay?

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.590
MSH reduces appetite

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.800
and it's a powerful molecule, all right?

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.460
So just put that on the shelf,

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.950
MSH reduces appetite.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.880
Now, there's another population of neurons

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.810
in the arcuate nucleus,
called the AgRP neurons.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.610
And there I'm truly not going
to read you what that stands for

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.220
'cause it's related to the mouse strain

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.410
it was first identified in,

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:22.410
but humans have these cells
as well, but AgRP neurons.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:27.020
The AgRP neurons stimulate eating.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.810
And anytime you are approaching food,

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.860
or you feel some excitement
about food or anxiety,

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.740
because some people actually experience

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.190
a kind of heightened anxiety.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.800
Some people actually get a
little bit of a resting tremor

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.633
before they eat,

00:15:39.633 --> 00:15:41.560
even if they don't have any
sort of eating disorder.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.710
There's kind of a ramping
up of autonomic activity.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.750
That's largely due to the
activity of these AgRP neurons.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:53.640
So, the activity in these
AgRP neurons goes way up

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.050
when animals or people are starved.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.730
And I don't mean starved
for long periods of time,

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.160
but I mean when they
haven't eaten for a while.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.720
And the activity of MSH,
the release of MSH goes up

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.450
when we've eaten.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.030
However, there are other
things that will stimulate

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.200
the release of things like MSH.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.470
So, just briefly the
experimental evidence,

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.640
if you kill AgRP neurons,
animals and people stop eating.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.530
There are people of lesions.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.230
They just stop eating,
they become anorexic.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.750
I know you're familiar with
anorexia as a clinical term,

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.540
but that's actually a term that's used

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.980
in the scientific literature

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.710
about a pattern of behavior, okay?

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.310
As well as a clinical term of course.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.763
If you were to stimulate the AgRP neurons,

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.930
animals or people eat like crazy.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.890
They will eat to the
point where they burst.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.700
Which just sounds horrible,
but it just tells you

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.750
this is the accelerator on eating.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:46.970
And yes, it has relationship

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.990
to the ventromedial hypothalamus
I talked about earlier,

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.200
but I don't want to go
back there just yet,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.670
we will circle back.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.640
So Melanocyte-stimulating hormone,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.450
such an interesting hormone.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.463
This thing can shut
down the desire to eat.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.493
The Melanocyte-stimulating hormone,

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.220
is released from the medial pituitary.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.790
We talked about the pituitary last time.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.490
This is a gland that is
very closely positioned

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.440
to the hypothalamus.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.000
Actually some of the hypothalamus neurons

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.590
actually project their neural connections

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.530
directly into the pituitary,
to release things like

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.710
gonadotropins and luteinizing hormones,

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:23.820
stuff we talked about last time

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.590
in reference to testosterone and estrogen.

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:31.590
But MSH is released from the
medial portion of the pituitary

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:36.623
and it stimulates the desire
to not eat, to cease eating.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.150
What's really interesting,

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.830
is that Melanocyte-stimulating hormone

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.140
is activated by ultraviolet light.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.380
And it's not activated by
ultraviolet light to the skin

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.930
or directly to pituitary,

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.950
it's activated by ultraviolet
light to the eyes.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.280
Now, if you've been watching this podcast

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.190
or listening to this podcast
for any period of time,

00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.860
or you've heard me on other podcasts

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.700
or you follow my Instagram,

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.220
I am a big fan of this whole
thing of getting morning light

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.410
in order to synchronize
circadian rhythms, et cetera,

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.040
avoiding light in the middle of the night.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.760
This is yet another reason

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.890
why getting ample light, ideally sunlight,

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.550
but it could be other sources
of UV light to the eyes,

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.710
stimulates MSH, this has been
shown over and over again.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.720
And keeps the desire to
eat or appetite in check,

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.320
in healthy ranges.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.690
This is also why in the
spring and summer months,

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.330
animals and people eat less.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.040
Now, for hibernating
animals it's different,

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.090
because they bear hibernate, actually.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.490
Ashley bears don't truly
hibernate technically,

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.880
by a scientific criteria
they don't hibernate,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.610
but they go into a kind of torpor.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.033
The hibernating animals
they don't eat much

00:18:46.033 --> 00:18:48.580
because they're in boroughs or dens,

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.150
or they're just wrapped
up in a little ball

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.740
or whatever it is that
hibernating animals do.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.530
So they're of course going to
eat far less in the winter.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.650
But that's a unique scenario,

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.920
we are not hibernating animals.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.520
But humans generally have greater appetite

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.330
in the cold winter months.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:02.700
And it's not just because of the holidays

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.630
and the abundance of food

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.020
that we're presenting ourselves with,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.080
but when we get a lot of
sun our appetite is reduced

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.300
or at least it's easier to control.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.710
And that is due in part,

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.850
because if you're getting
ample sunlight to the eyes,

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:21.463
it's converted into a
signal for the MSH neurons,

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.420
the neurons that release MSH, excuse me

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.390
these PMOC neurons release MSH.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.600
And then MSH can bind its receptors,

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.310
and can keep the break
on appetite in check.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.070
So the takeaway tool from this,

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.390
is make sure you're getting enough light

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.410
not just in the morning,
but throughout the day.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.190
And yes, it has to be light to your eyes.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.570
And blasting your eyes with
sunlight or artificial light

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.260
to the point where it's
damaging or painful,

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.240
won't accelerate or improve this process.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.870
It's about getting photons,

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.650
ultraviolet light to the eyes consistently

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.603
throughout the day.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.750
That's best accomplished
by not wearing sunglasses

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.060
provided you can do that safely.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.170
And if you don't have
access to enough sunlight,

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.550
then you can do this
with artificial light.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.610
This also points again to our old friends,

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:06.910
the blue blockers.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.850
Many people know I'm not a
huge fan of blue blockers

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.640
especially not during the daytime,

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.770
because they block a lot of the UV

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.470
and shorter wavelength
light that you want and need

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:21.070
to create alertness, but
also to create release of MSH

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.440
from the medial pituitary.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.890
Now there are people out there,

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.400
subcultures, that actually inject MSH.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.530
That are taking MSH or
things similar to it.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.690
I am not suggesting people do that.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:40.270
But there are three main
consequences of doing that.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.990
First of all, it reduces
appetite, no surprise there.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.310
And they're actually using
it as a dieting drug.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.030
This is kind of in the underground.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.430
I don't know what the legal status is.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.240
And again, I'm not
promoting that people do it.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.240
Two, it makes them very, very
tan, which makes sense, right?

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.850
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.820
And the third is, it
purportedly, never tried it,

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.850
purportedly sends libido through the roof,

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.580
to the point where it's
actually distracting

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.320
for other activities.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.260
It actually can create priapism,

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.420
which is a kind of
chronic erection in males

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.830
to the point where it actually
can be physically damaging

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.000
to the genitalia.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.893
So this is a drug,

00:21:19.898 --> 00:21:21.300
I don't know whether or
not it's call it a drug.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.000
It's a substance that one can
regulate with healthy levels,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.620
with sunlight and perhaps
artificial UV light.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.530
I have not heard much about
treatments for obesity

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.940
involving getting ample sunlight
or getting ample UV light,

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.760
but to me, the logic is just very clear.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.060
And so if you're pursuing those avenues,

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.090
you certainly should
talk to your physician

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.160
but you might want to think about

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.010
how some of those logic hangs together.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.340
Absolutely fascinating hormone,

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.350
I think most people aren't aware of it.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.400
And the subcultures that are aware of it

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.960
are using it for two very
particular end points,

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.170
and they're using it at
super physiological levels.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.060
That's enough about that
'cause I really don't know.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.950
I've talked to a few people in research.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.020
Believe it or not for this podcast,

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.290
I reached out to a few people

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.440
and asked whether or not
the these are side effects

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.320
in air quotes.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.120
I've heard about are true,
and indeed they're true.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.150
But again, that's super
physiological, controlling MSH,

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.300
it's actually Alpha MSH levels

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.020
through viewing ultraviolet light

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.750
seems like an interesting

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.840
and mechanistically logical thing to do,

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.050
if your goal is to keep appetite in check.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.560
So MSH inhibits hunger.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.780
Next, let's talk about a hormone peptide

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.870
that activates hunger.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.020
And this is a really interesting one

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.930
because it relates to when you get hungry,

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.830
in addition to the fact
that you get hungry at all.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.830
And it's called ghrelin,
it's spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.610
Ghrelin is released
actually from the GI tract.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:58.550
And its main role is to
increase your desire to eat.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.040
And it does that through
a variety of mechanisms.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.860
Part of that is to stimulate
some of the brain areas,

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.060
the actual neurons, that
make you want to eat.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.050
In addition, it creates
food anticipatory signals

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.040
within your nervous systems.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.490
So you start thinking about the things

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.420
that you happen to like to eat

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.487
at that particular time of day.

00:23:17.487 --> 00:23:18.840
And this is fascinating.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.690
Ghrelin is sort of like a clock,

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.120
a hormonal clock that
makes you want to eat

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.410
at particular times.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.120
Now, the signal for ghrelin
is reduced glucose levels

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.150
in the blood.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.860
We're going to talk a lot today
about glucose and insulin,

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.320
ways to manage glucose and insulin.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.700
But for now the simple version of this,

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.890
is you normally want your glucose

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.690
to be in a kind of modest range,

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.910
and I'll explain what
range is in a little bit.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:51.440
But if it drops too low, ghrelin
is secreted from your gut.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.920
It activates neurons in your
brain at various locations

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.240
including the PMOC neurons,

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.840
and the other neurons of the wingin' it.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.950
It also activates the
VMH in particular ways.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.680
And it might even activate
some of these neurons

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.470
that are in the periphery in your mouth

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.563
that actually make you salivate
and want to eat, right?

00:24:11.563 --> 00:24:14.340
Now, we all know about
the famous Pavlovian,

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.870
experiments of Pavlov's dogs.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.340
You know, they start
salivating to the bell.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.260
After the bell was presented
with food, you remove the food,

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.980
and then just the bell can
stimulate the salivation.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.830
We become Pavlovian at times.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.680
But rarely is it ever discussed

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.820
what the neural pathways for that are.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.233
And it turns out that these hormones

00:24:29.233 --> 00:24:32.590
that are secreted from the
gut can stimulate the neurons

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.060
to create a sensation and
a desire for certain foods

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.723
at certain times of day.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.930
You've done this experiment.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.170
If you are somebody who eats breakfast

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.230
at more or less the same time each day,

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.990
let's say 8:00 AM plus
or minus 20 minutes.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.740
And then you eat lunch 12:30
plus or minus 20 minutes.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.090
Or let's say you're somebody like me

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.350
who typically skips
breakfast, and just eats lunch

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.133
usually around 11:30 or
12 or something like that.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.310
Your ghrelin secretion will start to match

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.520
when you typically eat.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.640
And it does that.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.480
And it's able to override
the low levels of glucose

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.660
in your bloodstream,

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.130
because the ghrelin system also gets input

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:18.340
from a clock in your liver

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.150
that is linked to the
clock in your hypothalamus,

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:21.983
in your brain.

00:25:21.983 --> 00:25:24.330
And what this means is, if
you eat at regular meal times,

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.860
you'll start to get hungry a few minutes

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:26.970
before those meals times.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.640
If you've ever wondered why

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.810
your stomach kind of starts to growl

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.657
because it's a particular time of day,

00:25:32.657 --> 00:25:34.540
and you're like, Oh I must want to eat,

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.040
well, that's ghrelin.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.730
And for those of you that don't know

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.440
why your stomach growls, I'll
also tell you that today.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.040
It's actually really interesting.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.040
It not at all what you expect,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.700
and it's not just the gurgling
of liquids in your stomach.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.900
That's not what it is.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.820
It's actually a muscular phenomenon.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.280
So, ghrelin is secreted as
a food anticipatory signal,

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.550
to get you motivated to
go eat at regular times.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.480
So, nowadays there's a lot of interest

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.003
in intermittent fasting.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.170
There's also a lot of interest
in just what meal plans

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.350
and schedules and what to eat in general,

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.760
in order to maximize one's
health and wellbeing.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.980
And people have all
sorts of cosmetic reasons

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.260
and brain reasons and metabolic reasons

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.580
for wanting to control this kind of stuff.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.180
So let's make it really simple

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.350
by first looking at the extremes.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.090
Some people need to eat
every two or three hours.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.300
They feel this, "I need to
eat every two or three hours,"

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.550
or else their blood sugar drops.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.370
In general, blood sugar
doesn't drop so low,

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:34.870
that they truly need to eat

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.600
in order to alleviate a blood sugar issue.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.810
Although sometimes that can happen.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:42.480
Some people are truly
hypoglycemic, low blood sugar.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.950
But most people as the blood
sugar starts to head down

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:49.610
towards the low-ish ranges,
ghrelin is secreted.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:53.550
And so for those people
not eating on the clock,

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.940
it's very disruptive to them

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.520
because it activates these
neurons in the brain.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.290
For people who eat once
a day or twice a day,

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.160
or tend to shift their meals,

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.240
you know, and they might eat a lot

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.010
but during a limited
so-called feeding window,

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:09.530
it's kind of interesting humans
now eat and talk about foods

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.460
in ways that for years I used
to hear about in classes,

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.120
in courses, and research
lectures about feeding animals,

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.680
you know, restricted feeding windows.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.640
And we owe a great deal of
gratitude to Satchin Panda,

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.940
who was a colleague of mine
when my lab was in San Diego

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.860
at the Salk Institute, who
really is one of the pioneers

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.560
of this restricted feeding window work

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.720
and has done a beautiful work.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.570
He has a book that's excellent
called 'The Circadian Code'

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.750
that I highly recommend.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.620
And he's done a lot of important work

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.410
on neurons in the retina,
that control circadian timing,

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.110
but also the relationship
between feeding windows

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.270
and health.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:49.270
And he's sort of among the
major proponents I should say,

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.110
of circadian eating, that means
eating during the daytime,

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.100
not at night or intermittent fasting,

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.330
restricting feeding windows

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.560
to anywhere from four
to six to eight hours.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.750
I'll use myself as an example

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.910
of the transition from
regular feeding schedule

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:07.090
to a more intermittent-ish fasting,

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.210
although I don't really fall
into true intermittent fasting.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.290
So I was one of these people
that just got so accustomed

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:16.320
to waking up and eating about
an hour after I woke up.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.520
That to go from eating
every three or four hours

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.960
to eating twice a day, lunch and dinner,

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.830
maybe a couple of snacks in
the afternoon or something.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.660
At first it was excruciating.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.640
I remember thinking like,

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.830
this is really brutal pushing out feeding.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.620
I didn't think I could exercise
unless I had eaten first.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.480
We now know that during
most all forms of exercise

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.330
unless you're really focused
on optimal performance

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:39.760
like you've got to hit key lifts

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.940
or you have to sprint
at your maximum speed.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.080
And maybe even then that you
can exercise faster just fine,

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.460
because you're mainly relying
on sources like glycogen

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.180
from the liver, some
undigested food sometimes,

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.890
as gross as that may seem it's true,

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:58.610
as well as body fat if the
exercise about is extremely long.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.810
But what that means is
that if you suddenly go

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.990
from eating on a very regular
schedule to skipping a meal,

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:08.610
or pushing your meal timing
out or shifting at all,

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.120
you're going to have
ghrelin in your system.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.700
And that ghrelin is going to
stimulate the desire to eat

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.430
by acting at the level of your brain.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.180
And it is indeed at
that point, just mental.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.730
When we hear about just
mental, just physical,

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:19.800
it's really kind of the same thing

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.680
'cause it's all chemicals, brain and body.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.300
But it's the stimulation of
neurons that anticipate feeding.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.700
You're stimulating the
arcuate nucleus neurons

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.290
that make you want to
eat those AgRP neurons.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.940
So ghrelin stimulates the AgRP neurons,

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.600
which makes you want to eat.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.630
So what can you do with this?

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.680
What this means is,

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.270
if you want to start shifting
your feeding schedule

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.560
to one where you're not
eating quite as frequently,

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.160
and there are some advantages to that

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.450
that aren't just in the
biochemistry and health related,

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.660
you know, cellar health related things.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.200
But some of them include
not having to think about

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.870
or buy food, right?

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.840
You actually don't have to
think about food all day

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.470
if you're not eating so often.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:57.590
The other is, it gives you

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.470
a far more social flexibility, right?

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.780
You can go to a noon
meeting if you have to

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.077
or you can go out to dinner
at a particular time.

00:30:05.077 --> 00:30:06.560
And you know, I guess it
makes it kind of tough

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.100
if you want to meet
somebody for breakfast,

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.410
'cause then you're the dork

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.770
who's just like sipping black coffee

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.840
and like refusing everything.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.460
But anyway, I've been that dork.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.360
So it's one of those things
you just kind of work with.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.000
But the fact of the matter
is, ghrelin secretion,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.160
because of its relationship
to the nervous system,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.000
can be shifted by about
45 minutes per day.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.130
Now, it's going to vary.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.200
Some of you have more
so-called willpower, you know.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.460
But if you really want to just start

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:39.300
pushing that first meal out
or shifting in any direction,

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.960
some people might want to eat
in the early part of the day

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.070
and not in the evening.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.670
Trying to shift the
mealtimes out the spacing

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:48.630
by about 45 minutes, is
what the neural circuits

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.150
that link the ghrelin system
to the neural circuits

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.140
that control feeding, really can handle

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.250
because it's a form of neuroplasticity.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.490
And so what this would look like is,

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:58.650
if you normally you eat
breakfast at eight o'clock

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.300
plus or minus 20 minutes,

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.670
and you want to start eating
your first meal at noon

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.280
you would take maybe four or five days

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.510
and just start pushing the meal out

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.780
by about 45 minutes to an hour each day.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.610
So it's not quite as painful.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:12.460
Or you can just take the plunge
and just do it all at once.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.160
I have a colleague who was
a neurosurgeon at Stanford,

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.100
came up through my lab,
he's now at Neuralink,

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.170
and he has a great practice.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.430
He keeps his ghrelin system at random.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.790
What he does is he skips one meal per day

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.240
and he makes his external
schedule dictate that.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.340
So, sometimes he skips breakfast,
sometimes he skips lunch,

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.173
sometimes he skips dinner,

00:31:31.173 --> 00:31:33.880
he just skips one of the
three major meals per day.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.450
And in doing that, the ghrelin system

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.760
has always kind of kept off kilter.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.240
And it probably also allows him

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.050
to have a lot of neural flexibility,

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:42.420
what we call top-down control.

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.770
Just the knowledge, Oh, you
know the hunger I'm feeling

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:47.210
isn't necessarily hypoglycemia.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.460
And in his case, it's
almost certainly not.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.690
And therefore what I'm feeling here

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.230
is an activation of these AgRP neurons,

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.410
and therefore I can push
my meal schedule around

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:57.680
however I want.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.430
Now, I should mention that
top-down mechanisms are powerful.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:02.120
Belief, motivation,

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.020
these things can really
shift neural circuits.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.600
We're going to talk more
about that a little bit later.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.340
But there are also people who
are genuinely hypoglycemic

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.750
and they need to take really good control

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.010
of their blood sugar levels
and try and keep them stable.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.880
And so of course, you want to do

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.230
what's medically safe for you.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:18.690
I'm not at all recommending

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.530
that people that suffer from hypoglycemia

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.890
suddenly disrupt their
blood sugar patterns

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.520
in any direction, that
wouldn't be healthy.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.580
But for most people out there

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.780
who have reasonable blood glucose levels,

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.320
it's kind of interesting and kind of fun

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.780
to play with these parameters

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.640
in order to optimize what you want to do.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.420
And sometimes that might
change across the year

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.300
with schedules.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.380
Many find great benefit
in having flexibility

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.620
over when they eat.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:47.080
Regularity of eating equals
regularity of ghrelin secretion

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.120
equals regularity of activity
of these AgRP neurons,

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.250
meaning you'll be hungry
at very regular intervals.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.530
So that's something
that you can work with,

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:56.500
it's grounded in deep mechanism

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.680
of hormone and neural systems,

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.430
and there's a lot of modern research

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.220
to support what I just said.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.490
So, if MSH inhibits feeding,
makes us want to eat less

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:10.170
and ghrelin makes us want to eat more,

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.710
there's another hormone
called CCK, Cholecystokinin,

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:19.510
that is potent in reducing
our levels of hunger.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.340
Now, I learned about CCK back
when I was an undergraduate.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:27.340
So, well over 20 years ago,
when it was first discovered.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.480
And there was a lot of excitement
about CCK at that point

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.230
as a diet drug.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.410
You know, anytime there's a molecule

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.620
or a chemical discovered
in the brain or body

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.950
that can suppress feeding, the
diet industry just goes wild

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.240
and they think, this is
going to be the thing

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.340
that's going to allow people
to move from being obese

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.860
to losing all sorts of
unhealthy weight, et cetera.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.740
A similar phenomenon was
observed with leptin.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.630
Leptin is a hormone
that's made by body fat

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.880
that signals to the brain when
there's a lot of body fat,

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.130
and in animals injections of leptin

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.900
can make fat animals thin.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.850
They lose a lot of adipose or fat.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.040
In humans, it didn't work out that way.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.640
It just the studies were done
and leptin was successful

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.610
in treating a certain
rare form of diabetes,

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:17.380
but it really wasn't very
potent as an anti-obesity drug.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:22.380
Similarly, CCK has been
looked at as an obesity drug,

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.560
something to reduce obesity.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.160
But it had some pretty
unhappy side effects

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.440
actually caused some pretty
serious side effects.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.340
Now that's as drug.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:38.340
However, CCK when released
at normal levels by your gut

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.840
has a powerful effect

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.570
in suppressing appetite
for a period of time.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:48.430
And there are healthy and
direct ways to activate CCK.

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:52.100
Now, CCK is in the GI tract,

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.950
it's released from the GI tract.

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:56.680
And it's release is
governed by two things.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.970
One is a subset of very
specialized neurons

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.690
that detect what's in the gut,

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.280
the specific contents of the gut.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.340
And by certain elements of the mucosa,

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.270
of the mucus lining of the
gut and the gut microbiome.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.410
So what's really interesting,

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:18.410
is that CCK is stimulated by fatty acids

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.810
and particular fatty acids
that we'll talk about.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:25.330
Amino acids, and particular amino acids

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:28.950
that we'll talk about,
as well as by sugar.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:31.090
Now, let's put sugar on
the shelf for a moment.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.720
We're going to talk a lot about sugar

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:37.630
because if CCK inhibits
appetite and reduces feeding,

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:42.200
and it can be triggered by
fatty acids, amino acids,

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.880
or sugars, then you might say,

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.450
well, then in eating a lot of sugars

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.270
should make us not want to eat more,

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.230
but we all know that eating sugar

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.150
makes us want to eat far more.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.030
That's the role of a lot of sugars.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.770
And that has to do with
a separate mechanism

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.550
we'll talk about today.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:00.160
So, which fatty acids in the gut

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.160
stimulate the release of CCK?

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.790
It turns out it's the omega-3 fatty acids,

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:08.200
the ones that come from
algae or krill or fish oil.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.870
I talked about this in
the episode on nutrition

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.790
and some of the things
related to the gut microbiome.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.340
And I'm going to revisit that now.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:21.410
Omega-3 fatty acids and
Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA,

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.440
either from food or from supplements,

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.560
stimulate the release of CCK

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.810
which then reduces, or
at least blunts appetite.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.650
And I'm not talking
about blunting appetite

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.950
to anorexic levels where you
don't want to eat at all.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.500
I'm talking about regulating appetite

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.640
to the point where animals
and people don't over-consume.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.003
So it's keeping appetite
at a healthy level.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.750
The other thing that stimulates
CCK that I mentioned,

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.220
are amino acids.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.410
So when we eat, we have
the ability to break down

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:53.510
different macronutrients,
you know, carbohydrates, fats

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.110
or proteins, into sugars and glucose,

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.197
that then we can convert to ATP

00:36:59.197 --> 00:37:01.460
and all that stuff from a
Krebs cycle from high school.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.530
We're not going to go into that today,

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.180
that's for a future episode.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.450
But amino acids are one of the things

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:09.150
that we are eating for.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.770
Amino acids both can be used as energy

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:15.190
through a process called gluconeogenesis,

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.410
of converting proteins into energy.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.870
Or those amino acids can be broken down

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.990
and then rebuilt into things
like preparing, excuse me,

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:24.210
repairing muscle tissue

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:26.470
as well as other forms of cellar repair.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:27.530
They're involved in all sorts of things

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.680
related to protein synthesis.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.280
What does this mean?

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.140
If we eat the proper amino
acids at the proper levels,

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.790
if we ingest omega-3's and
CLA's, Conjugated linoleic acids

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:41.570
at the proper levels, or
get them from supplements,

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.430
there's a blunting of appetite.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.520
Appetite is kept clamped and
we don't become hyperphagic.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.600
We don't overeat.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.640
We tend to eat within
healthy or normal ranges.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.680
So this is very important,

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:57.550
because most people don't
understand that when we're eating,

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:02.050
we are basically fat foraging
and amino acid foraging.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.630
And there are several
studies now have shown,

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.190
that people and animals
will essentially eat

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:11.680
until they feel they've
consumed enough omega-3's,

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.670
omega-6's, CLA's, and certain amino acids.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:18.580
In other words, even
if it's not conscious,

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.820
we are eating until we
trigger the activation of CCK.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.950
Now, there are other reasons
why we shut down eating too.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:28.080
Are literally, the volume of
food in our gut can be large,

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.030
and we can feel very distended.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:33.450
That's the physical reason obviously.

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:34.870
There are other reasons,

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.040
maybe we just have top-down control.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.000
We have knowledge that
this is the end of the meal

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.380
and we stop 'cause we
have to go back to work

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.520
or to a meeting, or we tell
ourselves we've had enough.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.090
But at a subconscious level,

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:52.190
the gut is informing the brain
via CCK and other mechanisms

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.480
when we've ingested
enough of what we need.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.410
And these omega-3's and
CLA's and certain amino acids

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.840
are vital for sending out that
signal that we've had enough.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.640
Now, which amino acids is
actually really interesting?

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.910
We have essential amino acids

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.020
and we have non-essential amino acids.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.400
Among the essential amino acids,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.680
there's one in particular

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.760
that can trigger the release
of CCK very potently,

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.923
and that's glutamine.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.260
Glutamine is a very
interesting amino acid.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.260
First of all, it's been
shown in a few studies

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.370
to play a role in bolstering
the immune system.

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.380
It can increase the number of killer cells

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.430
in the immune system.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:31.370
It is consumed but in supplement form.

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:32.300
You know, people can take it.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.560
You know, a teaspoon of glutamine

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.780
or some people take
glutamine throughout the day,

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.020
if they're really into it
or for whatever reason,

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.580
they think they're
battling off an infection

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.110
or something of that sort.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.610
Glutamine can also of course
be derived from foods.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.980
And you can just put into the Internet,

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:46.840
do an Internet search

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.780
and find out what foods
are rich with glutamine.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.180
Some of the ones that I'm
aware of off the top of my head

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.240
are like cottage cheese,
and things of that sort.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.190
But other foods have glutamine as well.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.140
Once a threshold level of glutamine

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.460
and other essential
amino acids are reached,

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:05.010
once the threshold level of
these Alpha-3, excuse me,

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:09.250
Omega-3 fatty acids and CLA's
are reached, CCK is released,

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.690
and it helps reduce the activity

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.950
of those AgRP neurons
that promote feeding.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.900
So as you can see, feeding is an interplay

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.470
between brain and body.

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:20.140
And it's some of the micronutrients

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.210
and even the breakdown
of particular nutrients,

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.160
that's putting the accelerator

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.070
or the brake on the feeding process.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.730
It's not just one thing.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.663
So from an actionable standpoint,

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:35.270
you, we should probably all
be trying to get our omega-3,

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.500
Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.220
because they are antidepressant.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.750
I talked about the peer
reviewed studies on that.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.070
They are healthy for the gut microbiome,

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.460
and we should be seeking
sufficient glutamine.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.500
Now, whether or not you decide

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.000
to supplement with glutamine
or not, is up to you.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.080
One of the reasons why
one might want to do that,

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.880
and again, you should
always check with a doctor,

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.310
especially if you have any
predisposition to cancers

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:03.660
or you have cancer, many cancers
and tumors like glutamine,

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.020
so that's something to note.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:08.450
But one reason why you might
want to supplement with glutamine

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.690
or consider eating foods
that are rich in glutamine,

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:13.760
isn't just to keep your
appetite in healthy ranges,

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.540
but as well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.000
So this is very interesting.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.010
I have a friend, he's an absolute
chocolate, sweets addict.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:26.740
He's a grown adult, but he
eats candy and chocolate

00:41:28.189 --> 00:41:29.860
as if he was like a 14 year old kid

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.640
hanging out at the
local convenience store.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.330
It's really incredible.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.980
And he has probably a sugar addiction,

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.110
but he's very aware of this

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:40.430
and he's managed to kick
all other addictions.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:43.440
So, for whatever reason, it
stimulates his brain and body

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.940
in the ways that make him
want more, but he hates this.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.950
It's actually quite frustrating for him.

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:50.220
He's somebody who cares
a lot about his health.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.440
He took the approach that I
know many other people have

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.220
who know about this role of glutamine,

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.090
of taking a teaspoon

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:58.800
or a couple of teaspoons of glutamine

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.650
several times throughout the
day or anytime he craves sugar.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:06.000
And indeed, glutamine, well,
reduced sugar cravings.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.580
Some people who are really on
the kind of ketogenic front,

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.150
will mix it with a little
bit of half and half

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.983
and down that,

00:42:11.983 --> 00:42:13.090
and because I guess it
makes it taste better,

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:14.350
it's a little bit chalky.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:16.840
So, glutamine has some very
interesting properties.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.960
But I think for most people

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.933
that aren't suffering from
adverse levels of craving,

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:24.470
making sure you're getting
the right omega-3's

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.510
that can come from a variety of sources,

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:29.580
check out the episode we did on nutrition

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.260
if you want to learn more about that.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.840
And CLA's, and making sure

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.070
that you're getting enough glutamine

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:36.480
is going to be important for making sure

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.260
that the CCK signal gets through.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.150
The one thing I do want to
mention about glutamine,

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:45.930
it's a minor effect, but it
alone can have a small increase,

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:49.220
excuse me, it alone can
increase blood sugar.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.400
It's not a huge increase in blood glucose.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.590
But because the gut takes proteins

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.467
and breaks them down
into these amino acids,

00:42:55.467 --> 00:42:58.500
and essentially looking for
glutamine and things like it,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.303
other essential amino acids as well.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.980
When you ingest glutamine
or branch chain amino acids,

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:08.850
there is a small but real
increase in blood glucose.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.350
And that's because they
are essentially food.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.430
And there I'm talking about
the supplemental version.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:17.690
So, just know glutamine can
increase blood sugar slightly,

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.430
especially diabetics should know that.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.550
It can reduce sugar cravings.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:25.100
And just know that what your
gut is doing at a core level

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.620
is it's forging, it's waiting,

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.680
and it's trying to assess
levels of omega-3 fatty acid,

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.490
conjugated linoleic acid,

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:33.390
and glutamine, and other
essential amino acids.

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:37.060
You are essentially trying
to eat to get these nutrients

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.390
and then a signal can be
deployed up to your brain,

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:42.940
that you're not really interested
in eating that much more.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.100
Whenever preparing an
episode for this podcast

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.310
I'm always faced with
a particular challenge,

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.480
which is, how many tools should I offer

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.640
that involve doing something new?

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.590
You know, a new behavior,
a new exercise, supplement,

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:55.890
something, things of that sort.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:58.890
And how many should be
related to not doing things,

00:43:58.890 --> 00:43:59.723
avoiding things.

00:43:59.723 --> 00:44:00.980
It's never really fun to talk about

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.610
all the things that
we're supposed to avoid,

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:04.810
but some of them are so powerful

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:08.170
in light of the mechanisms
of a given topic

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:11.020
that I'd be remiss if
I didn't mention them.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.600
So now you understand how hormones,

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.843
and peptides like CCK and
ghrelin impact appetite.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:20.640
There's one particular aspect of food

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.800
that can powerfully impact CCK.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.380
And I think most people,

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.540
I'm guessing 99.9% of people out there

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.370
are not aware of this.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.990
And it has to do with
highly processed foods.

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.040
There's a lot of reasons

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.010
why one would want to avoid
highly processed foods.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.600
In fact, if you're
interested in that topic

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.900
and the history of whole foods,

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.930
transitioning to highly
processed foods in this country,

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:43.820
I highly recommend you
listen to a YouTube video

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.500
by Dr. Robert Lustig,

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.550
he's at university of
California, San Francisco.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.520
It's very easy to find, put
Stanford, Robert Lustig,

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.430
it was a talk hosted by Stanford.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:55.580
Gives a a beautiful description
of the history of this,

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.190
and why the food industry
started packing in

00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:59.830
additional sugars and salts,

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:03.480
and turning foods into commodities,
it's really fascinating.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.600
It has no conspiracy theory
is just all scientific facts.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.750
It's really a wonderful lecture.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:11.400
It has millions of views, it
should be very easy to find.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.550
We can provide a link
to that, and we will.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.350
There's another reason

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:18.240
to avoid highly processed foods however,

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.050
and that has to do with
what's called emulsifiers.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.990
Now, many of you are
familiar with emulsifiers,

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.250
even though you don't know it.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:28.247
When you put detergent in the laundry

00:45:28.247 --> 00:45:32.360
that contains emulsifiers,
the goal of that detergent

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.997
is to bring together fatty
molecules with water molecules

00:45:35.997 --> 00:45:38.470
and be able to dissociate
them and break them up

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.320
to get the stains out of
clothes and things of that sort.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.480
There are a lot of emulsifiers
put into processed foods.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.790
And those emulsifiers allow
certain chemical reactions

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:52.160
to occur that extends the
shelf life of those foods.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.610
So it's like candy bars and cereals,

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:57.560
and all sorts of things
that are in processed foods.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.370
The worst of which are the
typical kind of pastries

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:01.570
that you see at the convenience store.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:04.550
But this extends into
chips of various kinds

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:06.410
and even some meats of various kinds,

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:07.740
they pack this stuff into meats.

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.580
They have names like soy
lecithin and other things.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.490
Why are emulsifiers bad?

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:14.040
Okay, there are a lot of
reasons why they're bad,

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.460
but the reason why they're bad

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:18.050
for the mechanisms that we've
been talking about today,

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:20.410
is that when you ingest those foods,

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.090
you're bringing those
emulsifiers into your gut.

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:26.140
And those emulsifiers strip away

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.260
the mucosal lining of the gut,

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.580
and they actually cause the
neurons that innervate the gut,

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.100
that extend those little processes

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:37.650
we call axons into the gut, to
retract deeper into the gut.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.830
And as a consequence, you're
ingesting a bunch of food

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:43.950
and the signals like
CCK never get deployed.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.250
The signals that actually shut down hunger

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:47.690
are never actually triggered.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.990
And so, as a consequence
you want to eat far more

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:51.710
of these highly processed foods.

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:53.620
In addition, if you then go

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:56.030
from eating a highly processed food

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:57.460
to non highly processed foods,

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.260
you're not able to measure
the amounts of amino acids,

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.480
sugars, and fatty acids in
those foods as accurately.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.810
You've actually done structural
damage at a micro level,

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:10.200
but structural level damage, excuse me,

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.860
to the mucosal lining of the gut.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.190
Now, this can all be repaired

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.030
if you stay away from
highly processed foods

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.300
for some period of time.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.530
But the negative effects
of these emulsifiers

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:19.770
are quite real.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.373
So, to make it really clean and simple,

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.730
emulsifiers from highly processed foods

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:27.670
are limiting your guts ability

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:29.450
to detect what's in the foods you eat

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.850
and therefore to deploy
the satiety signals,

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:33.730
the signals that shut down hunger.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:36.720
In addition to that, there's
a parallel mechanism at play,

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.570
that I talked about in a previous episode

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.410
but I'll remind you again, that
you have neurons in your gut

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.660
that are sensing sugar,

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.780
and are sending a subconscious
signal up to the brain

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.423
via the vagus nerve.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:52.360
And those neurons trigger
the release of dopamine,

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.150
which makes you crave more of that food.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:56.370
So now you've got parallel signals

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:58.270
making you want to eat more sugar,

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:00.450
making you unaware of how
much sugar you've eaten,

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:04.610
and that are disrupting the
inputs to the nervous system

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:06.390
that signal to the rest
of your brain and body

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:08.460
that you've obtained enough fatty acids

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.990
and you've obtained enough amino acids.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:14.040
So these highly processed
foods are really terrible.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.910
And you know, I'm not out here to say,

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.580
you know, never enjoy a
processed food of any kind,

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.880
I'd be a hypocrite 'cause
I do eat processed foods

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.713
from time to time.

00:48:21.713 --> 00:48:23.160
Although the ones that I tend to eat,

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.800
I try and make of the healthier variety.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.880
But eating whole foods
has tremendous value

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.740
and eating highly processed food

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.890
has tremendous negative impact on the gut

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:34.540
and on the gut brain axis.

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:37.410
And so, recently there
was a paper that came out

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:38.740
in Cell, Cell Press journal,

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.660
it's kind of the apex of Cell journals,

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.010
which is a phenomenal.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:45.620
This paper showed that,
ingesting highly processed food

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:49.440
leads to more intake of not
just highly processed foods

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.870
but other types of food in general.

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:54.120
There was kind of an
overeating compensation

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.760
generally across foods

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.730
for people that consume
these highly processed foods.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:58.900
And there are a lot of other reasons

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.460
to avoid highly processed foods.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.970
So again, I don't like to
focus too much on the do nots,

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.360
I like to arm you with tools to do.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.837
But I think this visual of certain foods

00:49:07.837 --> 00:49:10.200
and these emulsifiers
actually stripping away

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.570
some of the critical lining of your gut

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.680
and disrupting the hormone
signaling to the brain

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:19.260
controlling feeding, is important
enough and cryptic enough,

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.060
meaning it hasn't been talked about,

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.130
it works at a subconscious level,

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:26.010
and that it's important
that people are aware of it

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:27.940
so they can make decisions
about what they do want to eat

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.940
or not want to eat for themselves.

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.020
Before moving on, I just
want to say one more thing

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.270
about highly processed foods.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:36.840
There was an absolutely beautiful study

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.270
done by my colleague,
Chris Gardner at Stanford,

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:40.420
exploring whether or not

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.210
certain diets were better than others.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:45.910
They looked at vegan,
vegetarian, omnivore,

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:47.870
I don't know if they
looked at all meat or not,

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.380
but they looked at the
different forms of diets,

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.840
intermittent fasting, et cetera.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.370
And they essentially found that,

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:55.760
whichever diet people adhered to,

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.150
whichever one they followed,
was equivalent to the others.

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:00.400
Provided that they followed it,

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.480
they lost the equivalent amount of weight.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.310
There really wasn't a strong
effect of the food type

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:08.280
or the pattern of eating, et cetera.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.537
However, in a study like that,

00:50:09.537 --> 00:50:12.780
adherence is very high because
people are a part of a study.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.440
And for many people,

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.180
the ability to adhere
to a certain eating plan

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:21.460
is one of the most, if not
the most powerful determinants

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.150
of whether or not a given diet

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:25.570
meaning nutritional plan works.

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:28.420
Now, this thing about highly
processed foods however,

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:29.890
is really diabolical.

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:32.210
Because it truly says,

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:35.050
and I think the recent
data in cell metabolism

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:37.110
and other journals really proves that,

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.580
a calorie is not a calorie.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.897
That's absolutely absurd
because of these emulsifiers

00:50:40.897 --> 00:50:44.350
and the contents of these
highly processed foods.

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:47.870
In fact, the data in
humans points to this.

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.810
So what they did is they
took in-patient adults,

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:53.040
so they had total control
over their food intake.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.220
And they received either ultra processed

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.450
or unprocessed diets for
14 days, as a short study.

00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:01.260
The diets were matched
for calories, sugar,

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.230
fat, fiber, and macronutrients.

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.220
So everything else was matched.

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.780
Just processed or non-processed
is the major variable.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.820
And basically what they found,

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.630
is that the people who are
eating the processed food diet

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:16.880
happened to eat much more, right?

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.370
This was after this period of
putting them on either diet

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.310
and clamping for all other variables.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:23.080
Then they would eat much more,

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.180
and the body weight
changes were much more.

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:27.510
And those body weight changes,

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.070
were such that they
couldn't be accounted for

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:31.690
by just increased calories.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.720
So, the bottom line is
that highly processed foods

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.600
are just bad for you.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.960
They increase weight gain.

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.740
They disrupt the lining of your gut

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.010
in a way that disrupts things like CCK

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:42.720
and proper satiety signals.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.210
And they contain a bunch of
things, in particular sugars,

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:47.650
but other things as well,

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:50.030
that disrupt not just the hormonal systems

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:53.510
but also the neural systems
that control the desire to eat

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.170
after the diet is done.

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:56.590
So there's just so many reasons

00:51:56.590 --> 00:51:59.600
why these highly processed
foods are terrible,

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.870
and they can explain a lot
of the ill health effects

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:03.900
that we've seen in the last 50 years

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.810
not just in the United States,
but all over the world.

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:09.193
That enormous increase in
diabetes, juvenile diabetes.

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.780
It's just remarkable

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.130
how far down the path of diet we've gone.

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:17.450
And it's clear, it's almost a smoking gun

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:18.590
what the cause of this is.

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:20.390
If you'd like to learn more about that

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.270
please refer to the Lustig lecture.

00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:27.120
He also spells out why non-processed foods

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.050
is far more economical in terms of

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.060
just at the level of the
household or individual

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.840
as well as at the societal level.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.850
Really interesting stuff,

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:36.550
I highly recommend you check it out.

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:38.480
So now let's move on
to some other hormones

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.220
that regulate hunger and
satiety, in particular insulin.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.180
Now, you've probably
heard of insulin before.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:48.570
Insulin is the thing that's
lacking in type I diabetics,

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:50.770
that's why they have to inject
insulin whenever they eat.

00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:53.340
The reason they have to do
that, is because when they eat

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.840
their foods are broken down into glucose.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.630
And in order to shuttle glucose

00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:59.690
to the appropriate tissues in the body,

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:03.420
and also to keep glucose levels
in check, you need insulin.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.950
So the simplest way to think
about insulin and glucose

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:11.193
is that when you eat, that food
is broken down into sugars,

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:15.400
that's true whether or not
it's fats or it's sugars,

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.900
or eventually if it's proteins,

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.333
they are oxidized into fuels as we say.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.480
And those fuels can be used

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.630
as the name fuel implies into energy,

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:27.320
they're eventually made into ATP.

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:28.556
There's a bunch of biochemical steps there

00:53:28.556 --> 00:53:29.870
we're not going to go into today,

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:30.860
but that's essentially how it works.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.850
You break down food into glucose.

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:33.980
Now, if you're ketogenic,

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.110
we'll talk about that in a little bit.

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:40.463
But in general, you eat,
food is turned into glucose.

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:44.400
Your blood sugar needs to be
kept in a particular range.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.580
Hypoglycemic means too low,
hyperglycemic means too high.

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:53.550
And what they called
euglycemic E-U, glycemic,

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.053
is the healthy range.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.253
Now, what those healthy ranges are,

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:02.180
in general the healthy
range, the euglycemic range,

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:06.410
is about 70 to a hundred
nanograms per deciliter.

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:07.640
But most of you aren't walking around

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.950
with a glucose monitor.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:11.000
Some of you are, but most of you are not.

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.520
The more important question
for us to address right now,

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.960
is why is it important

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.060
that glucose be kept
at a particular level?

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:22.020
Once you understand that,
keeping glucose in check

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.250
starts to have a rationale behind it

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:27.370
and the ways to do that start
to make a lot more sense.

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:32.370
So the reason is, if
glucose levels get too high

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:35.960
because of the way that our
cells in particular neurons,

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.693
interact with glucose,

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.700
high levels of glucose can damage neurons.

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:42.570
It can actually kill them.

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.050
You can start getting what
are called peripheral,

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:46.680
excuse me, neuropathies.

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.150
One of the symptoms of
some forms of diabetes

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:52.650
is that people start losing
the sensation of touch

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:55.090
in their fingers or their
hands or their feet,

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:56.610
and they can start going blind.

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:59.670
There's diabetic retinopathies.

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.610
So it's very important,

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:04.640
that insulin manage your glucose levels.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.710
Now, there's also type II diabetes

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:10.940
where there's insulin
secreted from the pancreas,

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.540
but people are insulin insensitive.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.730
There's a disruption in the receptors

00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:19.110
and insulin insensitivity
isn't quite the same

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:20.800
as having no insulin at all,

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.940
but it parallels some
of the same mechanisms.

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.080
Now, type I diabetes is often picked up

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:28.560
because someone has a sudden weight loss,

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.420
because they're not processing blood sugar

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.630
the same way they were before.

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:33.610
Type II diabetes is often,

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:36.430
although not always associated
with being overweight

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:37.990
and with obesity.

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:40.870
Both of them are challenging conditions.

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.480
Type II diabetes almost
always can be managed

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.623
by managing one's weight.

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:50.820
And of course there are
prescription drugs and supplements

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.910
that can help manage those.

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:53.670
We're going to talk about all of that.

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:56.240
But for most people that
don't have diabetes,

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.130
the important thing is to manage glucose,

00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:01.240
to keep it in that euglycemic range.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.490
And there are a number of
different ways to do that.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:06.910
Some of them are behavioral,
some of them are diet based,

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:09.810
and some of them are based on supplements

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:10.730
or prescription drugs.

00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:12.200
So let's talk about those now.

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.970
So if you eat, and in particular
if you eat carbohydrates,

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:17.350
blood glucose goes up.

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:20.660
If you eat fats, blood glucose
goes up to a far less degree.

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.960
And if you eat proteins,
depending on the protein,

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.150
it will eventually be broken down for fuel

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:29.430
or assembled into amino acid
chains for protein synthesis

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:32.640
and repair of other tissues
and bodily functions.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.503
But glucose goes up and
then is kept in range.

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:40.740
When you are hungry, you
secrete a different hormone

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.480
and that's called glucagon.

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.480
And glucagon's main role,
is to pull stores of energy

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.870
out of the liver and the muscles.

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:52.860
And once those are depleted,

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:55.730
you'll eventually tap into body fat, okay?

00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:56.780
So, and this is for people

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.550
that have a typical blood glucose range,

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:02.120
so that 70 to 100 euglycemic range.

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.360
So, the two kind of push and pull systems

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.520
that we're going to think
about now to keep this simple,

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:11.360
is that you have the insulin
system managing glucose,

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.670
and you've got the glucagon system

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:16.720
pulling energy out of
your liver and muscles

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.240
for immediate fuel.

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:22.500
And eventually you'll
pull fuel out of body fat

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.230
if you've been active for a very long time

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:26.500
and all your glycogen stores are depleted

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.380
or close to depleted.

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.000
So what does this all mean?

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.290
There's a lot of important biochemistry

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:34.430
and a lot of important cellar processes

00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:37.180
involved in whether or not
your anabolic or catabolic.

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.450
Whether or not you're breaking things down

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:39.550
or building things up.

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:44.380
Let's talk about feeding
in a simpler way, however.

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:47.590
And let's weave the tools
to manage blood glucose,

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:50.270
to keep it in check, as we do that.

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:52.320
So, let's say you had a meal

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.253
and that meal consisted
of rice, a carbohydrate,

00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:00.750
some meat or fish, let's
say a piece of salmon,

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:02.880
and some vegetable, some fibrous vegetable

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.330
like asparagus or cabbage
or something like that.

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:09.050
If you were to eat all of that at once,

00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:10.960
you know, you take a bite
of one, a bite of the other,

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.930
you're going to mix it up.

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:13.830
You know, one of these, it
all ends up in the same place

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:16.010
kind of people, mix it all up.

00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:18.550
Then you'll experience
an increase in insulin

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:20.490
and increase in blood glucose

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:23.420
that's moderately fast.

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:25.800
It's going to increase pretty quickly.

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.633
What's remarkable,

00:58:26.633 --> 00:58:29.760
is that the order that you
consume each macro-nutrient

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:33.940
has a pretty profound influence
on the rate of insulin

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.650
and glucose secretion into the blood

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:39.030
and how quickly those levels rise.

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:41.180
So if you will make it really simple.

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.560
If you were to eat the rice first,

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.960
your glucose would rise in a sharp spike,

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.710
especially if it doesn't contain any fats

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:48.600
to slow the absorption.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:51.400
Now, that might be good
if you're very hungry

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.930
and you want to get an
increase in glucose.

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:54.910
In fact, this is the reason

00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:58.690
why you're often served bread
before meals, because it is...

00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:01.090
And sometimes it's bread and butter,

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:02.800
or chips before meals or appetizers,

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.160
are designed to get your
blood glucose going up high

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.960
because big steep
increases in blood glucose

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:12.280
tend to promote the desire
to consume more glucose.

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.280
And this also relates
to the dopamine system

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:17.110
and the way that something
tasty in the mouth

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:20.770
and sugar in the gut and
fats and sugars in the mouth,

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:23.800
trigger the activation of a
lot of systems in the brain

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.420
and body to consume more
of whatever you have

00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:28.570
or whatever is available to you.

00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:33.173
So, the basic idea is
that eating carbohydrates

00:59:33.173 --> 00:59:35.070
and/or fats early in a meal

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:37.343
will give a steep rise in blood glucose.

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:41.000
However, if you were to eat
the fibrous thing first,

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.550
so a lot of chewing, but not
a big rise in blood glucose

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:44.460
because in general there's...

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:45.660
Unless it's laid in with sugar.

00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:47.910
Or something we're just talking about

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:50.680
some vegetable, fibrous vegetable,

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:54.680
that will actually blunt
the release of glucose

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.330
until you eat the fish and the rice.

00:59:57.330 --> 00:59:58.340
But believe it or not

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.290
it will actually blunt
the glucose increase

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:03.020
that the rice would cause.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:03.853
Now, I'm not talking about

01:00:03.853 --> 01:00:05.830
neurotically eating each macro-nutrient

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:06.700
separately in sequence.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.920
I'm just trying to give you a picture

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.980
of what's happening ordinarily.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.320
So what this means is,

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.930
if you feel a lot of food related anxiety,

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:16.530
or you feel you're one of these people

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.580
that you can kind of sense

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:21.110
like your blood sugar
increasing very quickly,

01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:23.150
a lot of people can sense
this, some people can't,

01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:25.570
has a lot to do with how well
they manage their blood sugar

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:27.570
as well as some of the
psychological factors.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:29.657
And yes, their family
and historical reasons,

01:00:29.657 --> 01:00:31.830
you know, I've got friends
who had a lot of siblings,

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:33.020
and when they sit down to eat

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.450
they have to really suppress the desire

01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:37.750
to not beat up everyone else at the table

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:38.583
and take all the food.

01:00:38.583 --> 01:00:39.940
It's sort of like not...

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.400
It's hard for them to understand

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.570
that there's plenty to go around,

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:45.430
because of their upbringing.

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:47.793
So there are psychological
top-down effects.

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.380
A lot of the psychology around food

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.377
is geared towards getting people
to be relaxed when they eat

01:00:52.377 --> 01:00:53.810
and these sorts of things.

01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:56.780
But these blood sugar
effects are real just cellar

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.740
and basic biochemistry

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:02.840
of how the body manages sugars
ingested into the blood.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.630
So what does this all mean?

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.760
It means that if you want a
steep increase in glucose,

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.840
you are very, very hungry,

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.410
then you should eat the
carbohydrate laid in food first,

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:15.060
or you should eat a bunch
of macronutrients combined.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.360
So that would be like the
hamburger or the sandwich,

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.810
the bread, the whatever's
in that sandwich altogether,

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:23.923
usually that's protein
and vegetables as well.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.340
If you want to have a more
modest increase in glucose

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.230
or you want to blunt
the increase in glucose,

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:35.480
then have the, at least some
of the fibrous thing first,

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.170
and then the protein and
then the carbohydrate.

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:39.800
You will notice that your blood glucose

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.610
will rise more steadily,

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:45.820
and that you'll achieve
satiety earlier in the meal.

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:48.190
Or at least you won't get this huge peak

01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:50.400
at sort of the Thanksgiving meal effect.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.490
Some of you are international,

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:53.450
so if you don't celebrate Thanksgiving

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:55.320
is a time of year where...

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.310
It used to be the one-time
a year or two times a year

01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:58.940
where Americans would
give themselves permission

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.860
to eat enormous meals.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.850
Now that seems to happen a lot more often.

01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:04.660
But there is this effect of you're full

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:05.930
and yet you're hungry for more,

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:07.840
that's because your blood
glucose has gone through the roof

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.140
and it's triggered a
number of other mechanisms.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:12.640
There's also usually a lot
of alcohol consumption,

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.690
and alcohol itself because it's a sugar

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:21.100
will increase blood
glucose very, very sharply.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.560
It depends on the alcohol,

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.500
some alcohols have more sugar than others.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.160
But basically what you're trying to avoid

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.650
are steep increases in blood sugar.

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:29.010
And the order that you eat foods

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:31.180
has an enormous impact on that.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.830
The other thing that
has an enormous impact

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:34.870
on how long and shallow,

01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:39.500
or how steep that curve of glucose is,

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.810
depends on on whether or not
you recently were moving,

01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:45.590
are moving or start moving after you eat.

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:48.930
So it turns out that
your blood glucose levels

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:52.380
can be modulated very, very
powerfully by movement.

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.060
If you did any kind of intense exercise,

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.570
or even just walking or jogging,

01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:59.170
or cycling anything before you eat

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:01.280
your blood glucose levels
will be dampened somewhat.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.530
And that has to do with the
release of something called,

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:07.060
some people call it GLUT4,
which sounds like glutton.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.980
Other people call it GLUT4.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.860
These are things that are
involved in shuttling glucose

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:13.340
to particular cells in the body,

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.290
namely toward muscle and glycogen stores

01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:17.420
and away from body fat stores.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.750
It has to do with sequestering
of glucose from the blood.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.840
The point is that, if you're somebody

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.560
who struggles with blood sugar regulation,

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.160
in addition to getting your
body weight in a healthy range,

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.003
doing all the other sorts of things

01:03:28.003 --> 01:03:29.253
that you should be doing,

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:34.310
the key thing is to try
and get some movement,

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:36.090
sometime as circuit meal.

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:37.050
Now, very few people

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:38.770
can actually eat and
walk at the same time,

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:40.470
although I do it all the time.

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:42.110
Not because I'm trying to
regulate my blood sugar

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.180
but just 'cause I tend to be busy.

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:45.160
I eat and drive, [mumbles] busy.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.830
Busy if I'm not giving this podcast,

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:48.280
or if sleeping, I'm eating,

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.580
but except the early part
of the day when I fast.

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.420
But the bottom line here is that,

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:57.350
if you, for instance take a
30 minute walk after a meal,

01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.200
your blood glucose will be blunted

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.130
in ways that are beneficial.

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:04.770
If you have exercised in the
recent hours before a meal,

01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:05.770
that can be beneficial.

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:07.860
The order that you consume
foods is beneficial.

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.920
And there are a few things
that you can consume

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.260
that can also adjust blood glucose levels.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.410
So let's talk about those,

01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:15.830
but I thought it was
important to really tamp down

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:18.070
that it's not just what you eat,

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:19.160
we talked about that before,

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.350
but also the order that
you eat those things,

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:22.183
believe it or not,

01:04:22.183 --> 01:04:24.000
whether or not you
combine macro-nutrients,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.980
carbohydrates, proteins and
fats and fibrous vegetables.

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:31.030
And whether or not you've moved recently.

01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:32.480
The higher intensity the movement,

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.060
the greater the GLUT4 increase,

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.480
and the more that the blood
glucose will be blunted

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.847
and you'll shuttle more
of that to glycogen

01:04:38.847 --> 01:04:40.220
and muscle stores.

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:42.490
And even just moving after a meal,

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:44.980
even just a calm easy walk,

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.860
can really adjust the ways in
which blood sugar regulated

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:49.130
for the better.

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:52.720
I don't want to perseverate
on this processed foods,

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.210
hidden sugars thing too much.

01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:56.070
But understanding now

01:04:56.070 --> 01:05:00.370
a little bit about how
insulin and glucose work,

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:03.050
you can probably imagine why hidden sugars

01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:04.310
are such an attractive thing

01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:07.160
from the standpoint of
processed food manufacturers.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:11.020
Because if they can put sugar
in that you can't even taste,

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.930
that sugar is going to
amplify the amount of glucose,

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:16.500
it's going to increase the
rate of glucose increase

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.550
into your bloodstream

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:19.750
and it's going to promote more feeding.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.620
So in that case, you're
really being tricked.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.000
It's not that you're actually reaching

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.450
for the additional appetizer

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:26.200
and your blood glucose is going up.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.480
The food that you ate

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:30.170
is actually increasing your
appetite as you eat it.

01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:32.950
It's a positive feedback loop.

01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:35.780
So don't want to demonize those
any more than I already have,

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:38.550
but you should be aware that
these things are happening

01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:40.700
at the level of your
bloodstream and brain.

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:44.520
The other thing I'd like
to address for a moment,

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.180
is this notion of stable blood sugar

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:50.660
versus lay bile blood sugar
or unstable blood sugar.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.550
Some people just have stable blood sugar.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:55.710
They can go long periods
of time without eating

01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:56.570
and feel fine.

01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:59.440
Other people get really
shaky, really jittery,

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.130
and/or when they do eat,
they feel really keyed up.

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:04.680
Sometimes they'll even sweat.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.950
Sometimes their vision will go blurry.

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:08.810
And some of that can actually be

01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:10.660
because they've become hyperglycemic.

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:14.550
And those effects that you experience

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:18.280
when you are hyperglycemic
are the early warning signs

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.320
of the kinds of things that damage neurons

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.470
and lead to the really terrible stuff

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:24.550
they talked about before
like peripheral neuropathies.

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:26.300
Now, it takes some time
for those things to occur,

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.790
those neuropathies to occur.

01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:30.140
But whether or not your blood
sugar is all over the place

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.060
or whether or not stable,

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.760
can be impacted by a number of things.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.890
One of those things is exercise.

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:38.950
So these days there's a lot of interest

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:40.380
in what they call zone two cardio,

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.100
which is that kind of steady state cardio,

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.590
where you can just nasal breathe

01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:45.570
even at pretty high output,

01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:47.770
where you could maybe have a conversation.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:50.090
Although I'm such a huge proponent

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.690
of nasal breathing during exercise,

01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:54.430
most forms of exercise
especially zone two cardio,

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:56.550
that you probably shouldn't be talking

01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:57.810
while you're doing that cardio

01:06:57.810 --> 01:06:59.960
unless it's absolutely essential.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.950
But periods of zone two cardio

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:07.010
that lasts anywhere from
30 minutes to an hour

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:09.310
or sometimes more for
your endurance athletes,

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.320
can create positive effects
on blood sugar regulation,

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:18.320
such that you people can sit
down and enjoy whatever it is,

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:19.640
the hot fudge sundae,

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.930
or whatever the high
sugar content food is.

01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:24.880
And blood glucose management is so good.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:28.600
Your insulin sensitivity is so
high, which is a good thing,

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.940
that you can manage that blood glucose

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:33.980
to the point where it doesn't
really make you shaky,

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.690
it doesn't disrupt you.

01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:39.430
And you know, to say nothing
of the weight-related issues

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:41.810
or the adipose fat gain, et cetera,

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:43.950
that's a separate issue
because people vary there.

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:48.950
But basically doing zone two
cardio for 30 to 60 minutes,

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.780
three to four times a week

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.910
makes your blood sugar really stable,

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:55.670
and that's an attractive thing
for a variety of reasons.

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:58.710
On the flip side, high
intensity interval training

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:01.230
or resistance training
AKA weight training,

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:04.600
are very good at stimulating
the various molecules

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.130
that promote repackaging of glycogen.

01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:10.940
So sprints, heavy weight lifting,
circuit type weightlifting

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.710
provided there is some
reasonable degree of resistance,

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:16.140
those are going to trigger
are all sorts of mechanisms

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.830
that are going to encourage the body

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:22.100
to shuttle glucose back into glycogen,

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.790
converting to glycogen,
into muscle tissue,

01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:25.680
restock the liver, et cetera.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.160
Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes some time.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.140
You know, if you do a couple
sets of tricep extensions

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.500
and some crunches, you're
not depleting your glycogen.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:37.640
Glycogen depleting workouts
are very high intensity.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.770
Generally they're less than an hour or so,

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.750
but those are the sort

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.770
that are going to lead to big increases

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:45.890
in the kinds of enzymes
and metabolic pathways

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.970
that are going to repack
glycogen and shuttle most things

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:51.440
towards restorage of foods

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.490
not into adipose tissue, not into fat,

01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:55.900
but taking glucose and
making it into fuels

01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:56.850
that you can access later

01:08:56.850 --> 01:08:59.550
for more of that high intensity activity.

01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:01.520
And I should mention that
one of the advantages

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.270
of high intensity interval training

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:07.790
or weightlifting of various kinds,

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:12.010
is that it causes long standing increases

01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:13.330
in basal metabolic rate.

01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:14.810
I don't want to go too far down this path

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:16.830
because we're going to do an entire month

01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:19.710
on human performance and
athletic performance.

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:22.710
But it's not just the increases in muscle

01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:26.600
that increase metabolism,
because muscle burns more energy

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.950
than other types of tissues,

01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:31.540
except your brain, which
truly burns the most energy.

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.460
Anyway is the main reason

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.673
why your basal metabolic
rate is what it is.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.690
Well, high-intensity training.

01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:39.710
So it could be sprints,

01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:41.270
it could be high intensity
interval training

01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:43.220
of different kinds, it
could be weight training,

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:47.280
also has an effect of
increasing thermogenesis

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.550
even long after you've
completed the exercise.

01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:51.710
So there's a long tail.

01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:54.590
There's a kind of post
exercise metabolic effect

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:55.900
that's also beneficial.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.440
So it's not an either or,

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.280
it's really that high
intensity interval training

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.290
and resistance training.

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:03.540
And things of that sort are
very good for one reason.

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:07.120
And the zone two cardio is
very good for other reasons.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.390
And now you can see why
it's just a healthy thing

01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:11.460
and why most people should
probably be doing exercise

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.230
most days of the week, if
not every day of the week.

01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:17.540
If your goal is to manage blood glucose

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:21.130
and your goal is to manage
some of the metabolic factors

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:23.290
that control repackaging of glycogen

01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:25.740
and encouraging excess glucose

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:28.430
to not get diverted into body fat stores.

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:30.660
We haven't talked a
lot about lipids today,

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:34.020
that's because most of today's
discussion is about hormones

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:36.150
and insulin is the dominant hormone

01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:40.040
in terms of mobilizing and
managing glucose in the body,

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.290
at least for most people.

01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:44.440
But fats are very important.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.290
And there's just a little
anecdote about fats

01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:48.810
that I think will be useful in thinking

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:50.500
about why you want to manage

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.617
what they call the LDL or HDL ratios.

01:10:52.617 --> 01:10:54.970
And this is deserving an entire episode,

01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:57.260
many, perhaps even several episodes.

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.570
But some of you may be
familiar with LDLs and HDLs,

01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:02.630
some of you may not.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:05.340
The LDL is low density lipoprotein.

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:08.170
This is the one that you
don't want it to be too high.

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:10.638
Castillo's dreaming, he's barking.

01:11:10.638 --> 01:11:13.020
He loves all forms of cholesterol

01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:15.670
but that's just Castillo dreaming.

01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:18.050
So LDLs are the ones that
you want to keep low.

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:19.980
You don't want those
to go excessively high.

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:22.360
HDLs, the high density lipoproteins

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.113
are the ones that are the
so-called healthy lipoproteins.

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:28.640
That's all fine and good.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.010
But you might ask yourself,
what are they doing?

01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:32.860
What is the actual role of these things,

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:36.700
and why would you want
healthy levels of HDL

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.500
and not too much LDL?

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.220
Well, one of the reasons is,

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:43.750
that fats don't like water, right?

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:45.640
They are hydrophobic.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.960
And yet you need to move
fats in your bloodstream,

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.180
all tissues in your body need fats.

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.630
They need cholesterols, they're...

01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:54.430
In last episode we
talked about cholesterol

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:56.560
is a precursor to the
sex steroid hormones,

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.810
estrogen, and testosterone
and other hormones as well.

01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:04.330
Well, HDL and LDL, actually coat fats

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:07.180
to allow them to be transported
through the bloodstream.

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:09.030
They do a number of other things as well.

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:13.280
But HDL, is a key component
of the delivery system

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.440
that brings those fats
to the liver, ovaries,

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.420
testes, and adrenals.

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:22.320
In other words, having
adequate levels of HDL is good,

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.830
because it allows fats to
be delivered to the tissues

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:28.330
that manufactured testosterone, estrogen,

01:12:28.330 --> 01:12:31.500
cortisol in healthy levels and the liver.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:35.340
So this is why when LDLs are too high

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:37.290
what's happening is
you're not getting fats

01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:38.190
to the correct tissues.

01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:40.160
And you can get buildup of fats

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.300
like fatty liver disease

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:43.630
and some of these things can happen.

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:45.080
A high sugar content

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.920
can even lead to some of
these fatty liver conditions

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.770
that starting to happen

01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:51.310
is actually the first time
in human history perhaps

01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:52.810
that we're aware of anyway.

01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:55.400
That we're starting to
see liver conditions

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.180
that normally were associated
only with severe alcoholism

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.590
starting to come from sugar content.

01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:01.600
So what does this mean?

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.150
This means keep your LDL
and HDL ratios proper.

01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:08.890
You want those HDLs in order
to deliver fatty molecules

01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:10.950
to the very tissues that use cholesterol

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:13.090
in order to manufacturer hormones.

01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:16.150
So how do you keep LDLs and
HDLs in their proper ratios?

01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:19.050
Well, a lot of people don't realize this,

01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:22.700
but the debate about dietary cholesterol

01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:26.033
and its relationship
to LDL and HDL ratios,

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:28.520
it is a barbed wire debate.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.050
I don't want to get into it right now.

01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:32.300
There are still a lot of open questions

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.160
as to how much dietary cholesterol

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.960
impacts LDL and HDL ratios.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.920
I don't want to get into that now,

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.900
I'm not taking a stance either way.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.570
But what is very clear,

01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:45.870
is that having highly elevated glucose,

01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:47.180
consuming too much sugar

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.320
or not managing glucose in your body

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.390
through some of the mechanisms

01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:52.880
that we've been talking
about up until now,

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.610
can also negatively
impact LDL, HDL ratios.

01:13:56.610 --> 01:13:59.190
So managing glucose goes way beyond

01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:00.980
just managing blood sugar,

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:03.510
and making sure that you don't
lay down too much body fat,

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:04.940
making sure your metabolism stays high

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.550
and making sure you're not
getting jittery at meals.

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:08.330
It also has to do with

01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:12.170
making sure that you're creating
enough of the molecules HDL

01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:15.690
and not too many of the molecules LDL,

01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:18.670
that are going to disrupt
the delivery of things

01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:20.200
to the organs of your body

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.580
that allow you to make healthy
levels of testosterone,

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.170
estrogen, and so forth.

01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:27.090
If that wasn't clear, let
me make this ultra simple.

01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:29.400
You want healthy levels of HDL,

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.820
and you want low levels of LDL,

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.640
because if you have ovaries

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:38.160
it will allow the fats that
need to get to the ovary

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.810
to produce estrogen, to get there.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:44.060
And if you have testes,
it will allow the fats

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:46.090
and the cholesterol
molecules that you need

01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:51.090
in order to manufacture
testosterone to get to the testes.

01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:54.250
As well, in order to have
proper adrenal function

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:55.480
and proper liver function,

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.240
you want HDL and LDL in
the healthy correct levels.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.910
So now we've talked a lot
about behavioral tools

01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:04.120
and the underlying biological mechanisms

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.800
that justify those tools in
particular circumstances.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:11.090
Now, I'd like to turn to
supplements and prescription drugs

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.560
that regulate the hormone systems,

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:16.040
controlling feeding and satiety.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.570
There are a huge number of these.

01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:19.600
Some have more powerful
effects than others.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.790
There are two that I want to describe

01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:25.000
because they've been getting
a lot of attention recently.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.280
First of all, there's a
prescription drug Metformin,

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.770
which was developed as a
treatment for diabetes.

01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:34.490
And it works potently
to reduce blood glucose.

01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:38.600
It has dramatic effects
in lowering blood glucose.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.600
Metformin involves changes
to mitochondrial action

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:44.560
in the liver.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.470
That's its main way of depleting
or reducing blood glucose.

01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:53.140
And it does so through the
so-called AMPK pathway,

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:56.860
and it increases insulin
sensitivity overall.

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.740
Metformin is a powerful drug.

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.510
In fact, I'm surprised that so many people

01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:05.460
have sought it out, given
that most of the people

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.730
that I'm aware of that sought
it out are not diabetic.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.820
I think for diabetics it
seems to be a useful drug.

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:13.310
For non-diabetics, it can also of course,

01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:14.560
lower blood glucose.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:17.700
It also has the potential
to make people hypoglycemic,

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.560
genuinely hypoglycemic.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.060
So, you really need to approach
Metformin with caution.

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:23.920
I get a little concern

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.140
when I hear about people
blasting Metformin,

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:30.450
simply because fasted states
or low blood sugar states

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:31.323
are healthy.

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.920
Doing that pharmacologically
can have long standing effects.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.620
You really want to
approach that with caution.

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:41.180
Now, there's a comparable drug,

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.570
it really should be called a drug.

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:44.230
But it's non-prescription,

01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:46.330
that's also in fairly
prominent use out there

01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:51.330
called berberine, B-E-R
B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.130
So berberine is a really
interesting compound.

01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:01.370
Its actions very much mimic Metformin.

01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:04.100
So let's talk about
berberine for a second.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:08.420
Berberine actually comes from
various plants and tree bark.

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:11.440
It is sold in supplement
stores, it's sold online.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.650
It is, as far as I know
unregulated, it is powerful.

01:17:14.650 --> 01:17:16.410
If you're going to
experiment with berberine,

01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:18.160
you definitely want to talk to your doctor

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.820
and you want to approach it with caution.

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:25.820
It also works to activate
the so-called AMPK pathway.

01:17:25.963 --> 01:17:27.450
AMPK by the way stands for

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:31.062
Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK.

01:17:31.062 --> 01:17:34.123
And it inhibits a protein
tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.500
I think that's enough nomenclature.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.390
It activates a certain pathway

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:41.950
that's associated with
fasting and low blood glucose.

01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:46.380
The effects of berberine
are as far as I can tell,

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:47.840
when looking at the literature,

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:51.833
are very similar if not
identical to Metformin.

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:57.010
Now, the number of studies
out there on this are many.

01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:58.650
So I'm just going to review a few of them

01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:00.140
and their major effects.

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:03.870
As always, I invite you
to check out examine.com.

01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:04.910
It's a wonderful website

01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:07.700
where you can put in any
supplement or compound

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.630
or biological goal for that matter.

01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:11.850
And it will list out the various effects

01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:13.240
in the human effect matrix.

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.830
So studies on humans,
if they're available.

01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:18.410
And it will tell you whether
or not they're strong effects

01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:19.780
or weak effects or modest effects.

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.853
And it will point to the
specific subject population,

01:18:21.853 --> 01:18:24.090
it's a wonderful resource.

01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:27.860
So berberine, not surprisingly
has very strong effects

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:29.000
in lowering blood glucose.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.940
There are four studies on this.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:33.310
In fact, they say that
berberine is one of the more

01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:35.210
if not the most effective supplements

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:36.450
for lowering blood glucose.

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:38.180
It talks about dosages there.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.270
Although I'll just mention
that I've tried berberine,

01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:44.720
and the dosages that are
typical on the bottle

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:49.170
of most supplements, is
much higher than I needed.

01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:51.900
So when I took berberine,
two things happened,

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.700
first of all, I got a
pretty splitting headache.

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.220
It gave me pretty vicious headache.

01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:59.890
So for me it was a no, almost immediately.

01:18:59.890 --> 01:19:03.300
The other thing is, I
became so hypoglycemic.

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.460
That in order to get
my blood sugar back up,

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:07.570
I think I ate something like 10 donuts

01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:10.920
and I didn't feel like I had
ingested all that much sugar.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:11.900
It was really kind of weird.

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.220
I was hyperphagic for sugar.

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.397
I was craving sugar, craving sugar

01:19:14.397 --> 01:19:16.320
and I was very thirsty as well.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.700
And so, I don't want to
promote any bad behavior,

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.480
but I know that certain people use this

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.020
when they've overeaten sugars

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.380
or they're doing their cheat days,

01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.860
something that I'm
personally just not a fan of.

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:28.650
And they want to keep
their blood sugar in check

01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:30.240
or they know they're going
to consume a huge meal.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.990
They'll take berberine to
keep blood glucose clamped.

01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:34.490
And it does do that.

01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:36.300
It has very strong effects.

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:39.550
Three peer reviewed
studies on HbA1c levels.

01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:42.690
HbA1c is something that can
be measured in a blood test.

01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:44.930
That is sort of an average readout

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:46.150
of your blood sugar levels

01:19:46.150 --> 01:19:48.150
over the previous two or three months,

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.130
sometimes shorter period.

01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:53.720
But that's mostly what HbA1c is about.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:58.540
So, it radically decreases
your blood sugar levels.

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.250
It actually lowers cholesterol.

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:01.970
It acts remember on the liver,

01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:06.260
and the liver is involved
in cholesterol metabolism.

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:09.340
And remember it's both
sugars, blood glucose,

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:11.880
and dietary fats.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.910
Perhaps it's still heavily debated

01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:17.320
in terms of how your
blood total cholesterol

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.870
HDL and LDL are regulated.

01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:20.850
So it seems to lower total cholesterol,

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:25.400
and it seems like it lowers
HDL and LDL in parallel.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.130
So that's interesting.

01:20:27.130 --> 01:20:29.447
One study showed a minor increase in HDL,

01:20:29.447 --> 01:20:31.230
the so-called good cholesterol.

01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:32.970
Insulin levels dropped, not surprising.

01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:35.770
Another study showed a
slight decrease in LDL,

01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:36.970
though seem to be kind of minor.

01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:38.180
Here's a kind of interesting one,

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:39.800
just to help you remember berberine

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.760
as of the fact that it
comes from tree bark,

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.770
isn't trigger enough to remember it.

01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:48.080
Direct contact of
berberine on canker sores

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.170
seems to eliminate canker
sores very quickly,

01:20:50.170 --> 01:20:51.250
which is kind of cool.

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:52.650
I've not had canker sores in a few years

01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:55.804
but when I dig down,
they're extremely painful.

01:20:55.804 --> 01:20:56.637
I don't like those.

01:20:56.637 --> 01:20:57.520
So that's kind of interesting,

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.850
and there's some study references there.

01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:01.700
I find it amazing that
these compounds exist.

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.450
You've got this
prescription drug Metformin,

01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:05.750
and then you've got berberine,
this stuff from tree bark,

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:07.970
and they have effects that
are essentially equivalent

01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:08.890
to one another.

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:11.050
So again, I'm not promoting their use

01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:13.060
or even their exploration,

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:15.520
but those compounds do
exist, they're out there.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.880
And check out examine.com
if you'd like to learn more.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:19.860
Certainly do your
reading, do your homework,

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:21.880
before you start just popping the stuff.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:26.880
And if you have hypoglycemia
or hyperglycemia,

01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:32.230
be especially careful and also
do understand that dosages

01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:33.870
and dose requirements vary.

01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:35.713
So if you do go down this path,

01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:37.960
really approach things carefully.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.350
Always start with the lowest amount

01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:41.850
that you could get away with.

01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:44.210
For me, the headache thing
just made it a no-go.

01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:47.920
I do keep a bottle of
it in a full disclosure,

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.030
in the odd chance

01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:52.510
that I feel like eating
a ton of doughnuts.

01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:55.960
It's not so much about not
ingesting the calories,

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.210
it's just that I don't like the feeling

01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:58.410
of being hyperglycemic,

01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:00.750
the blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:02.620
I do love donuts.

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:05.570
Other things that impact blood
glucose in supplement form.

01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:10.030
Chromium has been shown in
29 studies to have a minor,

01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:13.120
I want to emphasize a minor
effect on reducing blood glucose.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.270
Things like L-carnitine,

01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:16.100
something we've talked about
here on the podcast before

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:17.450
in terms of its relationship

01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:20.450
to power output in ATP production

01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:23.330
for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise,

01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:26.960
as well as sperm quality and egg quality.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.653
We talked about that long ago.

01:22:29.730 --> 01:22:34.730
Things like Panax ginseng
can have positive effects on,

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.140
I should say, can have effects

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.320
of reducing blood glucose slightly.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.780
I don't want to give a
valence to or judgment

01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:43.210
to whether or not it's
positive or negative.

01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:44.043
Here's something that's interesting

01:22:44.043 --> 01:22:45.090
that you should know about.

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:49.380
Caffeine has very reliably been shown

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:53.500
to increase blood glucose
just a little bit, okay?

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.530
So I always thought that caffeine
would drop blood glucose,

01:22:56.530 --> 01:23:00.430
but it actually can increase
blood glucose just slightly.

01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:01.880
Things like magnesium.

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.690
We talked about magnesium

01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:07.970
as a tool for enhancing
the passage into sleep,

01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:10.770
in particular magnesium
threonate and bisglycinate.

01:23:10.770 --> 01:23:14.840
Magnesium can also have a modest
reduction in blood glucose.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:15.750
You're just trying to get the impression,

01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:17.170
everything reduces blood glucose,

01:23:17.170 --> 01:23:18.410
but that's certainly not the case.

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:21.480
And then a couple episodes ago

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.500
when we were discussing nutrition

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.960
we talked about artificial
sweeteners, sucralose,

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.323
aspartame, NutraSweet.

01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:29.750
Some of those are generic names.

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:31.070
Some of those might be brand names

01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:33.810
and how they have negative
effects on the gut microbiome

01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:35.320
and that's supported
by a number of studies.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:40.320
There's one artificial sweetener,
it's stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A,

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:44.120
which seems to lower blood
glucose just slightly.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.970
And I still can't find data

01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:50.320
on whether or not Stevia
impacts the gut microbiome

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.110
in either direction.

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:53.430
Many of the things that I consume

01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:55.070
do have small amounts of Stevia in them.

01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:56.890
So I'd love to know if anyone out there

01:23:56.890 --> 01:23:59.540
is aware of quality
peer reviewed research,

01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:03.460
as to whether or not Stevia
impacts the gut microbiome

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:07.540
similarly or differently from
other artificial sweeteners.

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:08.373
Please let me know.

01:24:08.373 --> 01:24:09.400
Please send me the references.

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:10.233
I'd really appreciate it

01:24:10.233 --> 01:24:12.970
if put it in the comment
section on YouTube or elsewhere.

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:16.230
Comment section on YouTube
would be the best place.

01:24:16.230 --> 01:24:18.560
So Stevia seems to lower
blood glucose a little bit,

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.610
which makes it kind of an
attractive artificial sweetener

01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:24.820
if one is going to use
artificial sweeteners.

01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.980
But remember, sweet taste itself

01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:28.600
stimulates the desire to eat,

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.330
which will increase more blood glucose.

01:24:30.330 --> 01:24:32.290
So I'm guessing that they
probably cancel each other out.

01:24:32.290 --> 01:24:35.060
So you have to think
logically about these things.

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:37.390
Vitamin B3, so some of the B vitamins

01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:39.290
do indeed stimulate appetite

01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:41.490
by triggering increases in blood glucose,

01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:42.820
vitamin B3 in particular.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.300
I don't know if B6 does.

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:46.490
Things like zinc seem
to lower blood glucose.

01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:49.120
And then there've been an
enormous number of other things

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.520
that have been tested for
their roles in blood glucose.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:56.150
Apple cider vinegar, anything acidic.

01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:59.380
This is well-known now
that any kind of acidity,

01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.300
so it could be lemon juice or lime juice,

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:04.790
or Apple cider vinegar,
lowers blood glucose slightly.

01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:06.550
Some of those can also have other effects

01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:08.180
that we're not talking about today.

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:09.280
So that's kind of interesting

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.260
because there's a movement now

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:14.760
towards creating a sort
of people talk about

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.980
becoming more alkaline,
you know, what these...

01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:18.040
I hate to break it to you

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:21.290
but you don't really want
your body to be too alkaline.

01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:23.930
You want to stay in the right
pH or else you're start...

01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:26.740
There are conditions that
make you more alkaline.

01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:29.320
You don't want to be too
acidic or too alkaline.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.290
If you see a beverage or something

01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:35.010
that purports that ingesting that beverage

01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:37.090
is going to make you more alkaline,

01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:38.410
that is absolutely false.

01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:41.210
There's no evidence for that,
is impossible biochemically.

01:25:41.210 --> 01:25:42.900
It's just marketing.

01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:47.230
But nonetheless ingesting
foods that are acidic

01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:51.900
can make some slight
adjustments to the pH of the gut

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:55.890
in ways that can slow or
alter the absorption of foods

01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:57.970
and can blunt blood glucose.

01:25:57.970 --> 01:25:59.300
You can try this sometime if you want,

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.390
if ever you're feeling
kind of over sugared out

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:03.110
like you ate something
with too much sugar.

01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:05.110
You can drink a small
amount of lemon juice

01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:06.490
mixed with water or lime juice,

01:26:06.490 --> 01:26:08.300
and you'll notice that it will blunt

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:11.460
that kind of hyperglycemic
effect just a little bit.

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:14.420
Again, you don't want to
use this as a medical tool,

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.180
but the effect is fairly potent.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.890
And then, excuse me.

01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:21.010
And then there are a
number of other things

01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:23.040
like capsaicin and hot chili peppers

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.080
that will lower blood glucose.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.640
The list goes on and on,

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:30.270
The most powerful one is
absolutely berberine and Metformin,

01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:33.010
but that's really heavy caliber stuff.

01:26:33.010 --> 01:26:36.150
And the other ones I mentioned
have more minor effects.

01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:38.900
I do want to mention because
I'm sure some of you out there

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:40.380
are curious about the ketogenic diet.

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:43.040
I'm going to do an entire
episode about ketosis

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.720
and the brain and the body,

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:49.720
but the ketogenic diet has
been shown in 22 studies

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.840
to have a notable
decrease on blood glucose.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.180
And that is not surprising,

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:56.750
because the essence of the ketogenic diet

01:26:56.750 --> 01:27:00.230
is that you're consuming
very little or zero

01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:04.223
of the foods that promote big
spikes in insulin and glucose.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.420
If you consume enough protein,

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:09.210
some of that protein can
be converted into glucose,

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:11.170
of course, through gluconeogenesis.

01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:14.350
But the ketogenic diet
has a very strong support

01:27:15.589 --> 01:27:19.290
for its role in regulating
blood sugar, which is glucose.

01:27:19.290 --> 01:27:22.500
But the specific effects
of the ketogenic diet,

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:25.420
and one particular effect
that I'll address later

01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:26.870
but I'll mention now,

01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:29.620
which is, the ability
of the ketogenic diet

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:33.020
to adjust thyroid hormone levels

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:34.270
in ways that make it

01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:36.580
such that if you return
to eating carbohydrates

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.840
after being in ketosis for too long,

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.920
you don't manage fibroid
and carbohydrates as well,

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.500
that has been shown as well.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.180
So we're going to dive deep into ketosis

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.300
in a future episode.

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.840
So for you ketonistas does
out there don't worry,

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.200
I certainly have nothing
against ketogenic diet.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.650
I actually don't have anything

01:27:52.650 --> 01:27:54.810
for against any particular nutrition plan.

01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:57.450
I know it works for me, at
least at this stage in my life.

01:27:57.450 --> 01:27:58.990
And I'll update it if I need to.

01:27:58.990 --> 01:28:00.950
I'm simply trying to get
you as much information

01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:02.410
as I possibly can,

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:04.860
so that you can navigate
through that landscape

01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:08.560
in a way that's in keeping
with your particular goals.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.930
So now you understand
a lot about blood sugar

01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:12.100
and how it's managed,

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.980
and the ways that you can manage it better

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.420
depending on your particular needs.

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:19.900
This is also a good
opportunity for us to look back

01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:22.050
at some of the medical literature,

01:28:22.050 --> 01:28:25.370
because it really points
to just how far we've come

01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:28.050
in terms of understanding
these important mechanisms.

01:28:28.050 --> 01:28:30.010
And it points us in the direction

01:28:30.010 --> 01:28:32.480
of some actionable protocols.

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.480
So diabetes, which is these
huge increases in blood glucose,

01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:40.060
because there's no insulin,

01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:43.420
was known about as early as 1500 BC,

01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:45.260
which is just incredible.

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:49.800
And the way physicians then understood

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.980
that certain people had high blood glucose

01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:54.430
without actually knowing
what blood glucose was,

01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:57.420
is that they would take the
urine of particular patients,

01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:01.810
and they'd find that ants
preferably move toward

01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:06.370
and consume the urine of
certain patients and not others.

01:29:06.370 --> 01:29:09.360
And they understood that there
was something in that urine

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.470
that was correlated with the weight loss

01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:12.470
and some of the other

01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:15.740
probably very unfortunate health symptoms

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.240
that these people were experiencing.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:21.120
So they knew that there was
something in blood and urine.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.230
But you might be asking
yourself, wait, that's urine.

01:29:25.230 --> 01:29:29.980
But as I tell every kid
that I meet, two things.

01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:31.960
I tell a kid, your brain is here,

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:33.170
I make them point to their head.

01:29:33.170 --> 01:29:35.160
And then I tell them, do you know what?

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.940
Do you know that your urine
is actually filtered blood?

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:39.530
And they usually go, [grunts].

01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:41.560
I get parental permission
to do this first.

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.570
But most adults don't realize

01:29:43.570 --> 01:29:46.690
that your urine is actually
just filtered blood.

01:29:46.690 --> 01:29:49.690
And that's why if you
see blood in your urine,

01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:50.730
that's a problem.

01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:54.400
You want to filter the blood,
but urine is filtered blood.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:59.400
Now, this business of measuring
blood sugar from the urine

01:29:59.910 --> 01:30:03.030
has been something that lasted way beyond

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:05.760
these early stages of 1500 BC.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:09.313
It turns out that as late as 1674,

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:13.790
physicians at Oxford
university were figuring out

01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:18.440
who had pathologically high
levels of blood glucose

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.870
by analyzing their urine.

01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:24.350
And again, they were measuring
the sweetness of their urine,

01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:25.610
and this is medical fact.

01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:26.443
They would do this

01:30:26.443 --> 01:30:29.250
by taking urine samples
from different patients,

01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:31.310
and tasting them.

01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:34.500
And they developed an intuitive sense

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:38.610
of what excessively sweet urine was

01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:40.740
relative to the other
urines that they had tasted.

01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.670
So for those of you that are
in the medical profession

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:45.400
or those of you that are seeking
out the medical profession,

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.080
do you understand this
is not done anymore?

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:51.350
And you can also just
reflect on how far we've come

01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:53.770
in terms of the medical profession itself.

01:30:53.770 --> 01:30:55.820
In our ability to measure
things from the blood

01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:57.170
and measure things from urine

01:30:57.170 --> 01:31:02.170
without having to ask ants
which urine is sweeter

01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:04.960
or ask oneself, which urine is sweeter.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:08.470
So indeed we are making
progress as a species.

01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:11.440
Before we close out today I
want to talk about one more tool

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.440
that many of you will
probably find useful.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:18.170
I certainly have, I'm a
big consumer of caffeine,

01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:20.220
although I don't consume a ton of it,

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:21.770
I consume it very consistently.

01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:23.643
So I'm big on consuming Mate,

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.370
which is a strong caffeinated tea.

01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:30.180
And I generally do that early in the day.

01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.480
Although I do delay about
two hours after I wake up

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.480
for reasons I've talked
about in previous episode,

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.550
to maintain that nice arc
of alertness and focus.

01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:40.540
I do drink black coffee as
well, mushroom coffee as well,

01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:41.770
I love that stuff.

01:31:41.770 --> 01:31:46.680
But Mate, also called Yerba
Mate, is an interesting compound

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.480
because unlike coffee,

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:52.110
it has been shown to increase
something called glucagon

01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:54.900
like peptide GLP1.

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:56.650
And increase leptin levels.

01:31:56.650 --> 01:31:58.620
Now, we didn't talk a
lot about glucagon today.

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:01.620
Glucagon is really elevated
in the fasting state.

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.600
I mentioned that it's sort
of the opposite of insulin

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.480
in kind of rough terms

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.970
that's one way to think about it.

01:32:08.970 --> 01:32:13.310
But GLP1, or glucagon-like peptide one,

01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:15.760
is increased by ingesting Mate

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:19.840
and it acts as a pretty
nice appetite suppressant.

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.130
Now, I'm not trying to
suppress my appetite.

01:32:22.130 --> 01:32:24.290
I like to eat as I mentioned before.

01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:27.970
But it works really well
to stimulate the brain

01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:31.130
and to give you a level of alertness

01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:33.190
and to do a lot of the
things that coffee does.

01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:34.980
It also contains electrolytes.

01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:39.430
So we meaning our neurons and our brain

01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:42.010
run on a variety of factors,

01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:44.330
electrical activity and chemical
transmission, et cetera,

01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:47.420
but they require adequate
levels of sodium potassium

01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:48.990
and magnesium.

01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:51.860
So, if you were to learn the biology

01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:53.620
or the physiology of the action potential,

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:54.960
the firing of a neuron,

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:57.210
something we teach every first
year neuroscience student,

01:32:57.210 --> 01:33:00.390
and I'd be happy to teach
you if you're interested.

01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:03.230
You'll hear about sodium
rushing into cells

01:33:03.230 --> 01:33:06.400
and potassium entering and leaving cells

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.760
in order to allow neurons to communicate.

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.360
Electrolytes are critically important

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.500
for the function of the nervous system.

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:16.470
And many things that act as diuretics,

01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:20.260
that promote excretion
of water, like caffeine,

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.890
can also take electrolytes out along

01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:24.400
with in particular sodium.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.960
And sometimes the lightheadedness

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.980
or the brain fog that people experience,

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:29.570
isn't just because electrolytes are low

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:31.890
but because they're
kind of out of balance.

01:33:31.890 --> 01:33:36.120
So I like Mate because it has
electrolytes, it has caffeine.

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.830
It stimulates the release of
this glucagon-like peptide

01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:41.000
GLP1, and it's been a big help to me

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.690
in extending that early
morning fasting window

01:33:43.690 --> 01:33:46.630
out to about noon or so
when I eat my first meal.

01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:48.060
It also just tastes really good.

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.460
I don't drink it out of the gourd

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:50.900
even though I have Argentine lineage.

01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:53.860
The gourd to me it's just
kind of an inconvenience,

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.770
I drink it out of a mug.

01:33:55.770 --> 01:33:57.010
There's no promotion here.

01:33:57.010 --> 01:34:00.020
I have no relationship to
any Yerba Mate plantations

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.810
or companies, I just happen
to really like the stuff.

01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:08.590
And the fact that glucagon-like
peptide one is enriched

01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:11.560
or is released more when you drink Mate.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:15.050
And the fact that GLP1
can regulate blood sugar

01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:17.310
in ways that keep your blood sugar

01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:20.210
in that we called euglycemic,

01:34:20.210 --> 01:34:22.240
not too high, not too low mode,

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.090
is one reason why ingesting
Mate is attractive to me.

01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:27.840
If you go to South America,

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.210
well, you'll see especially
among Oregonians,

01:34:30.210 --> 01:34:32.070
but also Argentines, is
people actually carry

01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:34.740
a thermos of this stuff with them around

01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.580
and bring it to meals in restaurants.

01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:38.430
And it's just considered
cultural convention,

01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:40.130
it's not unusual to see that.

01:34:40.130 --> 01:34:41.990
So we don't see that so
much here in the States

01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:43.570
but I happen to really love this stuff.

01:34:43.570 --> 01:34:45.130
I brew my own,

01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:47.140
because that's the most
economical way to do it.

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:48.570
And I really enjoy it.

01:34:48.570 --> 01:34:51.000
It can be a little bitter for some people.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.460
The real key there if you want to know,

01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:54.570
the Mate trick is to not use water

01:34:54.570 --> 01:34:55.900
that's really boiling hot.

01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:57.230
You go just shy of boil

01:34:57.230 --> 01:35:02.010
and then it doesn't have that
same kind of tobacco like

01:35:02.010 --> 01:35:05.000
or really acidic flavor to it.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.620
It's just a little bit sweeter,
although not quite sweet.

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:13.170
So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can
manage in healthy ways

01:35:13.170 --> 01:35:16.240
leptin levels, glucose
levels, and glucagon levels

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:19.750
in ways that if it serves you,
that you might want to try.

01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:23.250
So once again, we covered an
enormous amount of material,

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:27.340
focused on how hormones
regulate feeding, hunger,

01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:30.330
and when one feels they don't need to eat,

01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:33.090
so-called satiety, that you've had enough.

01:35:33.090 --> 01:35:36.870
As always, we covered a lot,
but I could not be exhaustive

01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:39.920
about all the information
related to this topic.

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.150
It's just so vast.

01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:43.870
For instance, we did not
talk about thyroid hormone,

01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:47.050
an extremely important hormone and pathway

01:35:47.050 --> 01:35:48.400
in the body and brain.

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.650
We are going to do an
episode related to thyroid

01:35:50.650 --> 01:35:53.140
and tools to regulate thyroid, I promise.

01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:54.680
Having seen this episode,

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:58.853
you will be able to digest that
material with far more ease.

01:35:59.810 --> 01:36:02.240
We also didn't talk about the fact that

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.990
testosterone and estrogen
can impact blood glucose

01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:07.240
in ways that are opposite to one another.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.250
That when estrogen levels are high,

01:36:09.250 --> 01:36:11.670
appetite tends to be reduced.

01:36:11.670 --> 01:36:13.730
When testosterone levels are high,

01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:15.170
appetite tends to increase.

01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:17.260
So there are all sorts
of interesting interplays

01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:18.770
between the various hormones.

01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:21.720
But that's too much of a deep dive of now.

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:24.500
Right now, we've just focused today mainly

01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:27.800
on things like ghrelin, on things like,

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.310
Melanocyte simulating hormone,

01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:32.990
incredible powerful hormone
that can suppress appetite.

01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:36.580
On things like Cholecystokinin
that comes from the gut

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:38.320
and can suppress appetite.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.550
On things like food emulsifiers.

01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:42.580
On the fact that when you're eating

01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:44.750
you are amino acids seeking,

01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:46.420
even though you might not realize it.

01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:49.590
That you are also seeking
out particular fatty acids

01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:53.440
in particular, the conjugated
linoleic acids and Omega-3's.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.870
So I've tried to give you a
number of actionable tools.

01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:58.750
Many of them behavioral.

01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:00.980
Some of them are based on supplements

01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:02.530
or even prescription drugs.

01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:04.600
Again, always do what's
best for your health,

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.600
and do that in company with
a healthcare professional.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.880
I'm not a physician, I
don't prescribe anything.

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:12.440
I'm a professor, I
profess a lot of things.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.870
And I try and share with you
what I think to be the best

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:16.700
high quality peer reviewed literature.

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.240
So that's what I've done today.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:20.450
Really appreciate your time and intention.

01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:21.950
Many of you have continued to ask

01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:23.850
how you can help support the podcast.

01:37:23.850 --> 01:37:26.120
And we really appreciate the question.

01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.360
There's several ways to do that.

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:31.040
The first is to like a
video that you've seen

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.380
if you like it, and please
subscribe to the YouTube channel.

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:35.780
That's perhaps the most important thing

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:37.120
about the YouTube channel.

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:38.580
As well, leave us a comment.

01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:40.250
If you leave us a comment
in the comment section

01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:41.340
that helps us.

01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:43.170
And please ask questions.

01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:44.610
Those questions and your comments

01:37:44.610 --> 01:37:46.940
do inform content of future episodes.

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.040
We read them all.

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.470
Except the negative ones we don't read,

01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:51.610
I'm just kidding, we read them all.

01:37:51.610 --> 01:37:56.000
In addition, please subscribe
on Apple and/or Spotify

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.540
or both if you like.

01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.780
And on Apple, you have the
opportunity to leave us

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:02.450
up to a five star review if
you feel we deserve that.

01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:04.550
Apple also lets you leave a comment,

01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:06.810
some feedback for us as well.

01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:08.250
Please do check out our sponsors

01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:10.950
that we mentioned at the
beginning of the podcast.

01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:13.510
That's the best way perhaps
to support the podcast.

01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:15.260
As well we have a Patreon account.

01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:18.080
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.480
And there you can support the
podcast at any level you like.

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:24.670
And today, as well as
in previous episodes,

01:38:24.670 --> 01:38:26.420
I've mentioned various supplements.

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:28.620
If you're interested in
seeing what supplements I take

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.640
and you want to explore for
some other supplements as well,

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:32.860
you can go to Thorne

01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:37.860
T-H-O-R-N-E.com slash U, the
letter U, slash Huberman.

01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:41.370
Thorne is a supplement company

01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:43.840
that we believe to have
the highest stringency

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.340
in terms of what they put

01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:47.460
in the various supplements that they make.

01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:49.450
And the amounts that they
put are very accurate.

01:38:49.450 --> 01:38:51.510
They've partnered with the Mayo Clinic.

01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:53.610
They partnered with all
the major sports teams.

01:38:53.610 --> 01:38:55.210
And we've partnered with them

01:38:55.210 --> 01:38:57.420
because we believe in
their levels of stringency

01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:58.890
and accuracy.

01:38:58.890 --> 01:39:03.890
If you go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
you can see what I take

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:07.450
and you'll also get 20% off
any of those supplements

01:39:07.450 --> 01:39:10.270
or any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes.

01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:13.170
So that's where you can find
out more about supplements

01:39:13.170 --> 01:39:14.300
and the ones that I take.

01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:16.370
And again, you get the 20% discount

01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:18.830
on any supplements that Thorne makes.

01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:21.710
And last but not least,
thank you for being with us.

01:39:21.710 --> 01:39:22.860
I hope you learned a lot.

01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:25.420
I hope you explore some of the tools

01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:27.880
and that the mechanistic
information that you learned today

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:28.970
will serve you well.

01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:31.400
If you know anyone that's
interested in this topic

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:33.460
or you think that someone
could benefit from it,

01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:35.610
please suggest the
podcast to them as well.

01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:38.340
And most of all, thank you
for your interest in science.

01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:40.923
