00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.910
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science,
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.963
for everyday life.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.230
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.930
and I'm a professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.920
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.410
Today my guest is, Dr. Alia Crum.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.720
Dr. Crum is a tenured
professor of psychology

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.090
at Stanford university,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.450
and the founder and director

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.620
of the Stanford Mind and Body Lab.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.870
Her work focuses on mindsets.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.550
How what we think and what we believe

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.410
shapes the way that our physiology,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.690
our biology reacts to
things like what we eat

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.010
or stress or exercise.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.410
Indeed, as you will soon learn

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.240
from my discussion with Dr. Crum,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.580
what you believe about the
nutritional content of your food

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.310
changes the way that food
impacts your brain and body

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.740
to a remarkable degree.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.010
And the same is true for mindsets
about exercise and stress,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.670
and even medication.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.630
For instance, recent work from
Dr. Crum's laboratory shows,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.210
that what we believe about
the side effect profiles

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.750
of different drug treatments

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.400
or different behavioral treatments,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.520
has a profound impact on how
quickly those treatments work

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.970
and the effectiveness of those treatments.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.620
I just want to mention
one particular study

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.900
that just came out from a graduate student

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.590
in Dr. Crum's laboratory,
Lauren Howe, H-O-W-E,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.990
showed that, how kids react to a treatment

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.130
for peanut allergies,
can be profoundly shaped

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.210
by whether or not those kids were educated

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.310
about the side effects of the treatment,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.610
such that if they learned
that the side effects

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.780
were a by-product of a
treatment that would help them.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.820
And they learned a little bit

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.450
about why those side effects arose

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.240
and that the side effects
might even help them

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.520
in route to overcoming
their peanut allergy,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.350
had an enormous impact

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.380
on how quickly they move
through the treatment

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.790
and indeed how much they suffered

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.680
or in this case did not suffer
from those side effects.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.660
And that is, but one example
that you will learn about today

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.210
as we discuss what mindsets are,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.540
the number of different
mindsets that exist,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.000
and how we can adopt mindsets
that make us more adaptive,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.120
more effective,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.680
allow us to suffer less
and to perform better

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.350
in all aspects of life.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.680
I personally find the
work of Dr. Alia Crum

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.840
to be among the most important work

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.140
being done in the fields
of biology and psychology

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.730
and the interface of mind, body.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.090
Everything that she's done
up until now and published,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.230
and indeed the work that
she continues to do,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.560
has shaped everything
within my daily routines,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.380
within my work routines,
within my athletic routines.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.980
And we probably shouldn't be surprised

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.070
by the fact that Dr.Crum
works on all these things.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.380
She's not only an incredibly accomplished

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.010
tenured research professor,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.870
she's also a clinical psychologist

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.530
and she was also a division one athlete

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.260
and an elite gymnast at
one period in her life.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.190
So she really walks the walk

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.420
in terms of understanding
what mindsets are

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.680
and applying them in
different aspects of life.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.900
I'm sure you're going to learn
a ton from this conversation

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.240
as did I, and come away with
many, many actionable items

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.600
that you can apply in your own life.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.120
In fact, as we march into
today's conversation,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.970
you might want to just put
in the back of your mind,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.650
the question, what is
my mindset about blank?

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.970
So for instance, ask yourself,

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.530
what is my mindset about stress?

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.850
What is my mindset about food?

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.390
What is my mindset about exercise?

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.140
What is my mindset about
relationships of different kinds?

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.020
Because in doing that,
you'll be in a great position

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.200
to extract the best of the information

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.640
that Dr. Crum presents, and
indeed to adapt those mindsets

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.510
in the way that is going to
be most beneficial for you.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.240
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.620
that this podcast is separate

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.850
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.810
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.370
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.910
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.960
And keeping with that theme,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.620
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.670
Our first sponsor, is Thesis.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.440
Thesis makes custom nootropics

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.020
that are ideal for the
particular brain states

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.890
that you want to be in.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.180
The term nootropic means smart drug,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.770
and it is not a term that I like

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.470
because there is no such thing

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.860
as a universally useful smart drug.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.480
The reason for that, is that
our brain can be creative.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.690
We can be focused, we can
be good at task switching.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.250
And each of those different things,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.140
creativity, focus and task switching,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.370
involves different neurochemicals

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.970
in different states of mind and body.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.240
So the notion that
there's one best nootropic

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.580
is just not accurate.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.780
There's just no way
that could possibly be.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.120
Thesis understands this.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.710
And for that reason,
designs custom nootropics

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.380
that are designed to
bring your brain and body

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.760
into the states that you want,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.130
and that are specifically
designed to your neurochemistry.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.010
They use only the highest
quality ingredients,

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.970
many of which I've talked
about before on the podcast.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.470
Things like DHA, Gingko
Biloba, phosphatidylserine,

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.640
Alpha-GPC, is one that
I particularly like,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.060
and is in several of the formulations

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.510
that are customized for me.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.260
However, Gingko Biloba,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.990
which has a lot of research to support it

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.040
and is well tolerated by many people,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.020
doesn't work well for me, it
actually gives me headache.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.640
So that one is not included

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.230
in any of the custom formulations
that Thesis has made,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.160
particularly for me.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.110
Thesis has this tremendous asset,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.470
which is that they give you the ability

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.100
to try several different blends
over the course of a month

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.980
and discover which nootropics work best

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.830
for your unique brain
chemistry and genetics.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.230
So the formulas that work for me,

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.860
may not be the best ones
for you and vice versa.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.100
But in a short period of time,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.340
you can dial in the
exact nootropic formulas

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.290
for the states of mind and
body that you want to be in.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.310
I've been using Thesis for
close to six months now,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.350
and I can confidently say

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.020
that their nootropics have
been a total game changer.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.680
I love the motivation formula,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.100
I also like the energy formula.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.420
I use those for different
things, it turns out,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.340
but I love those.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.840
And I use their logic formula
and their clarity formula

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.580
that they've customized for me.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.310
In addition to their personalization,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.040
Thesis takes it a step further,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.390
they'll offer you a free
consultation with a brain coach

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.640
to help optimize your
experience with the nootropics

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.260
and dial in the best formulas for you.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.240
To get your own personalized
nootropic starter kit,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.380
go online to takethesis.com/huberman,

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.910
take their brief three minute quiz,

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.010
and Thesis will send you
four different formulas

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.430
to try in your first month.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.610
That's takethesis.com/huberman,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.470
and use the code Huberman at checkout

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.160

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.940
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Roka.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.070
Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.340
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.430
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.250
and I can tell you that our visual system

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.950
has to contend with a huge
number of different challenges,

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.550
not the least of which is
when we go from a very bright,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.670
sunny spot outside into the shade,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.190
our visual system has to adapt

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.630
in order for us to
continue to see clearly.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.190
Many sunglasses out there

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.040
just don't allow that adaptation
to occur in a seamless way.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.700
Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.670
are designed with all of the biology

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.740
of the visual system in mind,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.930
so that you always see
things with crystal clarity,

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.940
no matter what environment you're in.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.870
They also have a terrific aesthetic.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.980
They have many, many different
styles to choose from.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.140
So their eyeglasses can be worn to dinner,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.620
or out to lunch or to work.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.050
Their sunglasses can be
worn essentially anywhere.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.150
They're very stylish and they
were designed for performance.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.270
They won't slip off your
face if you get sweaty,

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.790
indeed, you can wear them
while running or while cycling.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.050
They're really terrific,
they're really versatile.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.580
If you'd like to try Roka glasses,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.260

and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.720
Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.860
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.420
that analyze the data
from your blood and DNA,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.170
to help you better meet your immediate

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.030
and long-term health goals.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.210
I've long been a believer

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.730
in getting regular blood work done.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.880
For the simple reason,
that many of the things

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.940
that impact your immediate
and long-term health,

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.440
can only be assessed from
a quality blood test.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.120
And nowadays with the
advent of modern DNA tests,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.620
you can also get a window

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.490
into how your genes are
impacting your health

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.640
in the short and long term,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.410
and the various things that you should do

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.070
in order to adjust your
health in the right direction.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.160
Now, one of the major issues

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.260
with a lot of blood tests
and DNA tests out there,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.290
is you get numbers back.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.730
And you learn whether or not

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.940
your lipids or your hormones, et cetera,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.160
are within the proper range or not.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.470
But there aren't a lot of directives

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.330
about what to do with that information.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.690
InsideTracker makes all of that very easy.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.570
They have a personalized dashboard

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.900
that allows you to, of course,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.110
see the numbers that come back to you

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.830
and to make various changes in nutrition,

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.770
various changes in exercise,

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.500
various changes in all
sorts of lifestyle factors,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.470
that can bring those numbers into range.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.530
And so, if you have a particular value

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.120
for a particular metabolic
factor or hormone or so forth,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.953
you click on that,

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:07.570
and it will actually
bring up the full menu

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.890
of things that you can do in
order to adjust that factor

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.310
into the ranges that you like,

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.180
all based on quality
peer reviewed research.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.530

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.300
And now, my conversation
with Dr. Alia Crum.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.570
Great to have you here.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.630
- Great to be here.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.510
- Yeah, for the record, it's Alia Crum,

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.290
but you go by Allie, correct?

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.260
- That is correct.
- Right, Dr. Allie Crum.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.640
- Or just Allie.
- Okay, great.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.550
Well, I've been looking forward

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.890
to talking to you for a long time.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.660
Just to start off, you've
talked a lot and worked a lot

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.660
on the science of mindsets.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.650
Could you define for us what is a mindset,

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.550
and what sort of purpose does it serve.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.970
- Of course, yeah.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.000
Mindsets have been described
or defined in a lot of ways.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.800
We define mindsets as core beliefs

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.230
or assumptions that we have

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.520
about a domain or category of things,

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.410
that orient us to a particular
set of expectations,

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.010
explanations and goals.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.980
So that's kind of jargony,
[chuckles], a little.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.640
I can distill it down for you.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.080
So mindsets are an assumption
that you make about a domain.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.950
So take stress, for example.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.670
The nature of stress.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.160
What's your sort of
core belief about that?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.540
And mindsets that we've
studied about stress,

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.210
or do you view stresses
enhancing good for you,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.570
or do you view it as
debilitating and bad for you?

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.030
Those mindsets, those core
beliefs, orient our thinking,

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.750
they change what we
expect will happen to us

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.930
when we're stressed,

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.180
how we explain the occurrences that happen

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.620
or unfold when we're stressed,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.260
and also change our motivation
for what we engage in

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.790
when we're stressed.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.560
So we have mindsets about many things,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.280
mindsets about stress,
mindsets about intelligence

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.300
as Carol Dweck's work has shown.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.403
Mindsets about food, mindsets
about medicine, you name it.

00:10:06.403 --> 00:10:09.060
It's sort of distilling
down those core assumptions

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.540
that really shape and orient
our thinking in action.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.373
- I've heard you say before,

00:10:13.373 --> 00:10:16.060
that mindsets simplify life in some way,

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.640
by constraining the number of things

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.963
that we have to consider.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.020
And it sounds to me like
we can have mindsets

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.890
about many things as, as you said.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.350
What are some different mindsets?

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.080
I think many people are familiar

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.260
with our colleague, Carol
Dweck's notion of growth mindset.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.560
That if we're not proficient at something,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.820
that we should think about
not being proficient yet.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.310
That we are on some path to proficiency.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.820
But what are some examples of mindsets,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.890
and how early do these get laid down,

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.800
or do we learn them from our parents?

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.370
Maybe if you could just
flesh it out a bit for us

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.080
in terms of what you've observed

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.240
in your own science or your own life.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.100
- Yeah, sure, so I think it's important

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.170
with Carol Dweck's work.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.530
A lot of people kind of get focused

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.160
on growth, motivation
and all these things,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.470
but her work really originated

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.280
from thinking about, what she
called as implicit theories

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.050
or core beliefs about the
nature of intelligence

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.420
or ability, right?

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.050
So do you believe that
your baseline levels

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.440
of intelligence or your abilities,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.300
are fixed, static, set
throughout the rest of your life?

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.690
Or do you believe that
they can grow and change?

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.660
Now, those are over-simplified
generalizations

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.640
about the nature of intelligence.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.700
And the reality is as
it always is complex,

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.930
and it's a bit of both
and it's all the things.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.660
But as humans, we need
these simplifying systems

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.130
to help us understand a complex reality.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.680
So those assumptions that we jumped to,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.030
oh, intelligence is fixed or
intelligence is malleable,

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.650
they help us to simplify
this complex reality,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.280
but they're not in consequential, right?

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.670
They matter in shaping our motivation.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.180
And as she has shown,
if you have the mindset,

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.900
that intelligence is malleable,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.350
you're motivated to work harder,
to grow your intelligence.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.920
If you have a setback in
your learning, you think,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.170
okay, there's something there

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.360
that I can grow and learn and build from.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.660
If you have the mindset that it's fixed,

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.890
you know, why work harder at math,

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.550
if you don't think you're good at it.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.490
So, in retrospect, it's pretty clear

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.900
how these mindsets can
affect our motivation.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.590
What our work has and to do

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:33.590
is to expand the range of
mindsets that we are studying,

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.250
focused on, and also understand and expand

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.390
the range of effects that they have.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.900
So by and large, we focused on mindsets

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.040
in the domain of health
and health behaviors.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.390
So I mentioned mindsets about stress,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:52.210
we've also looked at mindsets
about food and healthy eating.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.610
So do you have the mindset that
foods that are good for you,

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.710
healthy foods are
disgusting and depriving,

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.350
or do you have the mindset that
healthy foods are indulgent

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:04.690
and delicious?

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.290
Now, it could be a variety
of different foods.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.190
You might have different thoughts

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.350
about different healthy foods.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.580
But generally people, at least
in our culture in the West,

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.670
have this view that,
stress is debilitating,

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.160
healthy foods are
disgusting and depriving.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.480
And those mindsets, whether
or not they're true or false,

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.460
right or wrong, they have an impact.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.460
And they have an impact,

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.770
not just through the
motivational mechanisms,

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.470
that Dweck and others have studied,

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.600
but as our lab has started to reveal,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.380
they also shape physiological mechanisms

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.380
by changing what our bodies
prioritize and prepare to do.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.670
So those are just two examples.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.960
Mindsets about stress, mindsets
about food we've looked at.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.660
Mindsets about exercise,

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.440
do you feel like you're getting enough,

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.950
or do you feel like you're
getting an insufficient amount

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.560
to get the health benefits you're seeking.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.930
Mindsets about illness.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.930
Do you view cancer as an
unmitigated catastrophe,

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.440
or do you view cancer as manageable

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.530
or perhaps even an opportunity.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.500
We've looked at mindsets about
symptoms and side effects.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.710
Do you view side effects

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.120
as a sign that the treatment is harmful,

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.220
or do you view side effects

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.530
as a sign that the treatment is working?

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.580
Again, these are sort of core beliefs

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.140
or assumptions you have about
these domains or categories,

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.310
but they matter because they're shaping,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.550
they're synthesizing and
simplifying the way we're thinking,

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.990
but they're also shaping what
we're paying attention to,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.330
what we're motivated to do,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.330
and potentially even
how our bodies respond.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.780
- Yeah, I'd love to talk about this notion

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.500
of power of the mindset
shaping how our bodies respond.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.550
And maybe as an example of this,

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.810
if you could share with
us this now famous study

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.580
that you've done with the milkshake study,

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.070
if you wouldn't mind sharing

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.963
the major contours of that
study and the results,

00:14:58.963 --> 00:15:01.387
because I think they're
extremely impressive

00:15:01.387 --> 00:15:03.090
and they really speak to this interplay

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.060
between mindset and physiology.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:05.893
- Certainly, yeah.

00:15:05.893 --> 00:15:07.310
This was a study that I ran

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.150
as a graduate student at Yale university.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.310
I was working with Kelly
Brownell and Peter Salovey.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.770
Peter Salovey had done a lot of work

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.420
on really coining the term
emotional intelligence,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.265
studying [mumbles].
- He's now the president

00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:19.400
of Yale, right?
- He's now the president

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.160
of Yale, yes.
- So he's done well.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.240
- He's done well for himself

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.700
and for the university and society.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.090
And Kelly Brownell, who
was doing a lot of research

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.230
on food and obesity.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.660
And I had come in doing some previous work

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.300
on mindsets about exercise and
placebo effects in exercise,

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.330
and was in this sort of food domain

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.470
and this emotions and food domain.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.670
And it really occurred to me,

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.570
that there was a very simple question

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.120
that hadn't been probed yet.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.580
And that was, do our beliefs
about what we're eating

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.740
change our body's physiological
response to that food,

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:59.160
holding constant, the objective
nutrients of that thing.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.400
So that question might
sound outrageous at first,

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.900
but it's really not outrageous

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.020
if you're coming from a place

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.710
of having studied in
depth, placebo effects.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.750
Placebo effects, in medicine, at least,

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.810
are these sort of a robust demonstration

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.260
in which simply taking a
sugar pill, taking nothing,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.840
under the impression that
it's a real medication

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.080
that might relieve your asthma,

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.350
reduce your blood pressure
and boost your immune system,

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.450
can lead to those physiological effects

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.640
even though there's no
objective nutrients.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.230
And we have more evidence
on placebo effects

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.073
than we have for any other drug.

00:16:38.073 --> 00:16:39.010
- Really?

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.870
- Because of the clinical trial process,

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.760
in which all new drugs and
medications are required

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.860
to outperform a placebo effect.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.290
So we have a lot of data
on the placebo effect.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.810
Now, you know, we can get nuance there.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.640
We don't have a lot of data
comparing the placebo effect

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.440
to doing nothing, which is important

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.820
for distilling mindset
effects or belief effects

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.140
from sort of natural
occurring changes in the body.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.070
But anyways, going back to
this question, it was like,

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.200
all right, we've moved

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.940
from medications solving our health crisis

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.000
to behavioral medicine
solving our health crisis,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.480
increase people's exercise,
get them to eat better.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.470
To what degree are these things
influenced by our mindsets

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.170
or beliefs about them.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:30.170
So to test this question, we
ran a seemingly simple study.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.850
This was done at the Yale center

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.050
for clinical and translational research.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:39.380
And we brought people into
our lab under the impression

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.180
that we were designing
different milkshakes

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.500
with vastly different
metabolic concentrations,

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.560
nutrient concentrations,

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.810
that were designed to meet
different metabolic needs

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.490
of the patrons of the hospital, right?

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.620
So, you're going to come in,

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.270
you're going to taste these milkshakes,

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.270
and we're going to measure your
body's physiological response

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.140
to them.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.290
This was within subjects design.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.660
So it was the same people

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.350
consuming two different milkshakes,

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.710
two different time points
separated by a week.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.090
And at one time point,

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.750
they were told that they were consuming

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:15.020
this really high fat, high
caloric indulgent milkshake.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.810
It was like 620 calorie,
super high fat and sugar.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.610
The other time point, they were
told that it was a low fat,

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.000
low calorie, sensible sort of diet shake.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.050
In reality, it was the exact same shake.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.030
It was right in the middle.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.830
It was like 300 calories,

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.970
moderate amount of fats and sugars.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.290
And we were measuring their
body's gut peptide response

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.123
to this shake.

00:18:37.123 --> 00:18:40.100
And in particular, we are
looking at the hormone ghrelin.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.723
So as you know, ghrelin,

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.710
medical experts call
it the hunger hormone,

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:50.230
rises and ghrelin signal,
you know, seek out food.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.980
And then theoretically,

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.550
in proportion, the amount
of calories you consume,

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.210
ghrelin levels drops
signaling to the brain.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.900
Okay, you don't need
to eat so much anymore,

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.770
you can stop eating,

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.690
and also revving up the metabolism

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.800
to burn the nutrients
that were just ingested.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.740
What we found in this study was that,

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.450
when people thought they were consuming

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:14.190
the high fat high calorie
indulgent milkshake,

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.010
in response to the shake,

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.380
their ghrelin levels
dropped at a three-fold rate

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.870
stronger than when they thought

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.650
they were consuming the sensible shake.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.490
So, essentially their bodies responded

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.400
as if they had consumed more food,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.510
even though it was the exact
same shake at both time points.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:38.080
So this was really
interesting and important

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.260
for two reasons, really.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.730
One was that it was, to my knowledge,

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.670
one of the first studies
to show any effects

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.400
of just believing that you're
eating something different

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.810
on your physiology.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.160
Lots of studies have shown that

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.010
believing you're eating different things

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.960
changes your tastes and
even your satisfaction

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.160
and fullness after.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:57.993
But this shows

00:19:57.993 --> 00:20:01.430
that it has a metabolic or
a physiological component.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.650
But the second piece was
really important as well.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.440
And especially for me, this was one study

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.930
that really transformed
the way I think about

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.250
how I approach eating.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:16.250
And that was the manner in which
it affected our physiology,

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.590
was somewhat counterintuitive.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.160
So, I had gone in thinking,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.200
the better mindset to be in when you eat

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.920
is that you're eating healthy, right?

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.240
Like, you know, just makes sense.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.780
Like placebo effects think you're healthy,

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.613
you'll be healthy, you know.

00:20:28.613 --> 00:20:32.290
But that was a far too simplistic
way of thinking about it.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.650
And in fact, it was the exact opposite

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.240
because thinking that they were eating,

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.000
when these participants thought
they were eating sensibly,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.130
their bodies left them

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.120
still feeling physiologically
hungry, right?

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.590
Not satiated.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.000
Which could potentially

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.750
be corresponding to slower
metabolism and so forth.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.210
So, if you're in the interest

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.780
of maintaining or losing weight,

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.260
what's the best mindset to be in?

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.040
It's to be in a mindset that
you're eating indulgently.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.040
That you're having enough food,
that you're getting enough.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.873
And at least in that study,

00:21:05.873 --> 00:21:08.660
we showed that has a more adaptive effect

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.610
on ghrelin responses.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.810
- So interesting.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.940
And especially interesting
to me as a neuroscientist

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.650
who has worked on aspects
of the nervous system

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.060
that are involved in conscious perception,

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.890
like vision and motion and
color perception and so forth.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.640
But also, our lab has worked

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.440
and is increasingly working
on autonomic functions

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.220
that are below our conscious detection.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.970
In this case, a lie
about how much something

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.890
these milkshakes contained
affected a subconscious process,

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.580
because I have to imagine
that the ghrelin pathway

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.850
is not one that I can decide,

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.210
oh, this particular piece of chocolate

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.990
is going to really reduce my ghrelin

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:49.620
'cause it's very nutrient rich,

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.020
as opposed to one,

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.540
if you told me that a
different piece of chocolate,

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.150
for instance, is a low calories
or sugar free chocolate

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.150
or something that sort.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:01.760
The ghrelin pathway, however,
it seems based on your data,

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.360
that the ghrelin pathway
is susceptible to faults,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.710
which is incredible.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.870
But then again, there must be crossover

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.070
between conscious thought
and these subconscious

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.840
or kind of autonomic pathways.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.523
So, it's really remarkable.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.130
It raises a question
that I just have to ask,

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.240
because it increasingly,

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.100
so I'm involved in online
discussions and social media,

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.047
in one of the most barbed
wire topics out there,

00:22:30.047 --> 00:22:31.970
and that's being generous,

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.010
is this topic of which
diet or nutrients are best?

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.730
You've got people who
are strictly plant-based,

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.430
you've got people who are omnivores,

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.930
you got people who are carnivores.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.450
You have every variation.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.730
You have intermittent fasting,

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.300
also called time restricted feeding.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.050
And it seems like, once a group

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:51.680
and it plugs into a
particular mode of eating

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.510
that they feel works for them,

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.800
for whatever reason,
energy wise, mentally,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.340
maybe they're looking
at their blood profiles,

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.690
maybe they're not.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.940
But once they feel that it works for them,

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.960
each camp seems to tout
all the health benefits

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.340
and how great they feel.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.260
Could it be that mindset
effects are involved there?

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.940
That people are finding
the nutritional program

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.670
that they feel brings them
the most enrichment of life,

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.370
but also nutrients.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:21.490
And that their health really is shifting

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.410
in a positive direction,

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.740
but not necessarily because
of the food constituents,

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.400
but because of the community,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.020
and the ideas and the reinforcement.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:28.960
- Yeah, and the belief

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.900
that this is the right
way of doing something.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.900
I think, a hundred percent it
has something to contribute.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.230
I'm not going to weigh in on the debate.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.950
What I will most certainly weigh in on,

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.530
is the notion that,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.680
look going back to the
placebo effect, right?

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.820
We have a outdated
understanding of what that is,

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.410
which is based on this
randomized controlled trial,

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.300
you compare a drug to a placebo.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.370
If the drug works better than the placebo,

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.370
you say, great, the drug works.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.380
If the drug doesn't
outperform the placebo,

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.350
you say the drug doesn't work.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.090
That's really over simplified.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.830
It's a good test for the
specific efficacy of the drug.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:10.990
It's not a good test

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.020
for understanding the
total impact of that drug.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.320
Because in the reality of things,

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.300
if a drug outperforms a placebo,

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.930
then you start prescribing it.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:27.180
But the reality is, that the
total effect of that drug,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.430
is a combined product

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:33.750
of the specific chemical
attributes of that drug

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.580
and whatever's going on
in the placebo effect,

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.150
which is, at least from our perspective,

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:42.210
its beliefs, its social context,

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.230
and it's your body's natural ability

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.040
to respond to something.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.950
So, that's in the placebo effect example.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.190
The same is true for
everything we do or consume.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:56.373
So when it comes to
what diet you're eating,

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.740
both are true.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.370
It does matter what it is

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.390
and it matters what you
think about that diet

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.470
and what others around you

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.610
in our culture think about that diet.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:13.440
Because those social
contexts inform our mindsets,

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.560
our mindsets interact with our physiology

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.920
in ways that produce outcomes
that are really important.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.840
So let's not get dualistic

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.440
and say, it's either all in
the mind or not in the mind.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.260
Let's also not be unnecessarily combative

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.290
and say, oh, it should be all plant-based

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.810
or keto or whatever.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.800
It's all of those things
are a combined product

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.650
of what you're actually doing,

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.390
and what you're thinking about.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.040
If you believe in it, if you
don't, if you're skeptical,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.000
or in some cases,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.300
you think you should
be eating a certain way

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.620
and then you don't live up to that.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.437
It might have even an adverse
effect because of the stress

00:25:53.437 --> 00:25:55.910
and the anxiety associated with that.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.400
- Very interesting.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.110
Along the lines of belief effects,

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.560
could we call these belief
effects or mindsets?

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.830
- Sure, yeah.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.030
- Is there a difference

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:07.381
between these what I'm
calling belief effects

00:26:07.381 --> 00:26:09.560
and placebo effects?

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.460
I mean, are placebo effects
distinctly different

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.660
from mindset effects or they
more or less the same thing.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.493
- They're related?

00:26:15.493 --> 00:26:17.223
So I think placebo effects,

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:22.080
maybe should be reserved
for the conditions

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.090
in which you're actually taking a placebo,

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.270
which is inactive substance.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:31.790
When you get out of that sort
of placebo versus drug realm,

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.240
and you start looking at placebo effects,

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.760
I use quotes with my hands
here, in behavioral health,

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.220
the term kind of becomes
confusing because you're not--

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.100
In the milkshake study,

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.850
we didn't give people a
placebo milkshake, right?

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.330
We just changed what
they believed about it.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.840
So, how I like to think about it is that,

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.250
placebo effects, as they're
traditionally construed

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.580
are made up of three things.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.550
It's the social context,
mindsets or beliefs,

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.900
and the natural physiological processes

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:06.540
in the brain and body that
can produce the outcomes.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.850
And so, we could just
call them belief effects

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.760
because the beliefs are triggering

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.700
the physiological processes,

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.470
and the beliefs are shaped
by the social context.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:19.303
Does that make sense?

00:27:19.303 --> 00:27:20.270
- It makes sense.
- Yeah.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.220
- Yeah, there was a
paper a year or two ago

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.090
published in science magazine

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:28.970
about brain regions involved
in psychogenic fever.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:32.090
That if people or you can actually do this

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.700
in animal models to
think that they are sick,

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.180
you get a genuine one to three degree

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.680
increase in body temperature,

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.880
one to three degrees Fahrenheit
increase in body temperature

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.390
is pretty impressive.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.223
- Yeah.

00:27:42.223 --> 00:27:45.010
- And I guess it plays into
symptomology generally.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:47.593
So, I'm a believer in belief effects.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.540
- Just say that, you know,

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.700
the term that we use in our field

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.560
is nocebo effect for that,

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.570
which is sort of the
placebo's ugly stepsister.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:02.190
It's when negative beliefs
cause negative consequences.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.017
So, you are told you will have--

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.270
It's very well demonstrated

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.890
that when people are told
about certain side effects,

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:14.340
they're far more likely to
experience those side effects.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.830
When people think that they're
sick or going to get sick,

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:22.230
sometimes that can create
the physiological symptoms.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.530
And there's various debates.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:28.310
That it's not only that
physiology changes,

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.120
it's also that your attention changes.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.210
So we're experiencing things
like fatigue and headache

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.990
and upset stomach all the time.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.380
And then when you take a
drug and somebody says,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.660
you're going to feel fatigue and headache,

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.350
you start noticing that you're tired,

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.520
and that headaches attributed to the drug.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.920
So, some of the mechanisms are attention,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.183
and some of them are real
changes in physiology.

00:28:54.849 --> 00:28:59.160
- I'd love for you to tell us
about the hotel workers study.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.993
- Yeah, sure.

00:28:59.993 --> 00:29:01.347
- I know you get asked these
questions all the time,

00:29:01.347 --> 00:29:04.870
but I find just these
results also amazing.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.360
- Yeah, no, I think that
this is a really good example

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.800
of this phenomenon, right?

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.380
That the total effect of anything

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.730
is a combined product of what you're doing

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.190
and what you think
about what you're doing.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.640
So this was a study that
I ran with Ellen Langer

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.150
way back when I was an undergrad actually.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.770
We started this study.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.550
Ellen Langer is a professor
of psychology at Harvard,

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.270
and she's done a lot of
really fascinating work

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.000
on her flavor of mindfulness,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.430
which is distinct from
a more Eastern mind,

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.023
Buddhist sort of mindfulness-based work.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.880
She actually was the one
who said to me originally,

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.370
you know, I was an athlete at the time.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.170
I was an ice hockey player
and I was training constantly.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.390
And one day I'll never forget it.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.140
She said, you know the benefit of exercise

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.580
is just a placebo, right?

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.823
And I was like, well, that's outrageous.

00:30:01.811 --> 00:30:04.410
Ellen's known for saying very provocative,

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.580
but also very wise things.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.390
And that statement really
got me thinking about that.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:13.910
So we designed this study
together and that was to look at,

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.140
how would you study?

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.730
If the benefits of
exercise were a placebo,

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:19.190
how would you even test that?

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.610
Because, what does it mean
to give a placebo exercise?

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.000
So we sort of flipped it on its head.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.860
And we found a group of people

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.520
who were getting a lot of exercise,

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.150
but weren't aware of it,
that they were, right?

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.800
So this, we settled on a
group of hotel housekeepers.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.070
So these are women working in hotels

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.570
who were on their feet all day long,

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:44.563
pushing carts, changing
linens, climbing stairs,

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.920
cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.070
It was clear that they were
getting above and beyond

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.870
at least the surgeon General's
requirements at that time,

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.610
or which were to accumulate 30 minutes

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.823
of moderate physical activity per day.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.760
But what was interesting
was when we went in

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.570
and surveyed them and asked them,

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:05.380
Hey, how much exercise do
you think you're getting?

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.740
A third of them said, zero.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.950
I don't get any exercise.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.400
And the average response was like a three,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.270
on a scale of zero to 10.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:18.490
So it's clear that even though
these women were active,

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.240
they didn't have that mindset, right?

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.760
They had the mindset that
their work was just work.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.970
Hard, maybe thankless work
that led them to feel tired

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:30.350
and in pain at the end of the day.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.970
But not that it was good for them,

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.640
that it was good exercise.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.310
So what we did was we took these women

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.550
and we randomized them into two groups,

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:42.550
and we told half of them that
their work was good exercise.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.570
In this case, it was
true factual information.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.340
We oriented them to the
surgeon General's guidelines.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.173
We oriented them

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:51.750
to the benefits that
they should be receiving.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.110
And then we had measured them previously,

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:58.610
on their physiological metrics,
like weight and body fat

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:00.070
and blood pressure.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.970
And we came back four weeks
later and we tested them again.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.120
And what we found was that these women,

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.640
even though they hadn't changed
anything in their behavior,

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.370
at least that was detectable to us.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.570
They didn't work more rooms,

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.430
they didn't start doing
pull-ups or push-ups

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.290
in between cleaning hotel
rooms, as far as I'm concerned.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.653
They didn't report any
changes in their diet,

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.750
but they had benefits to their health.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.130
So they lost weight.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.980
They decreased their
systolic blood pressure

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.120
by about 10 points on average.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.960
And they started feeling
better about themselves,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.420
their bodies and their
work, not surprisingly.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.640
- That's amazing.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.490
How do we conceptualize that result

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:45.740
in light of all of our efforts

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.039
to get more out of exercise, right?

00:32:48.039 --> 00:32:50.060
Because earlier you mentioned
it from the milkshake study

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.890
and our perceptions
about nutrient density,

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:56.060
that the right message

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.800
that is actually a little
bit counterintuitive.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.630
That if you think, oh,
this is very low calorie,

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.720
nutrient sparse, then it's good for me

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.410
in the context of losing
weight for instance.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:07.630
But it turns out the opposite is true,

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.650
because as you told us, the
body responds differently

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.390
when you think something is nutrient dense

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.120
and can actually suppress hunger more.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.452
So, in light of this
result, if I were to say,

00:33:18.452 --> 00:33:22.960
okay, my current understanding
of the literature

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.840
is that getting somewhere

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.500
between 150 and 180 minutes per week

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.840
of cardiovascular exercise

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.090
is probably a good idea for most people.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.740
If I tell myself that
it's not just a good idea,

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.150
but that it's extremely effective

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:35.690
in lowering my blood pressure

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.960
and maintaining healthy
weight, et cetera, et cetera,

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.940
according to these results,

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.470
it will have an enhanced
effect on those metrics.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:43.303
Is that right?

00:33:43.303 --> 00:33:44.136
- Definitely.

00:33:44.136 --> 00:33:45.950
So this is a really important point,

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.630
because what this reveals

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:51.460
is that we have to be more thoughtful

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.010
in how we go about
motivating people to exercise

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.700
or teaching people about the benefits.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.760
Our current approach is just
to basically tell people,

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.320
writ large, here's what you need to get.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.900
Here's what you need to get good for.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:11.900
To get enough exercise to
receive the health benefit.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.400
The problem with that approach is that,

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.840
most people aren't meeting
those benefits yet,

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.240
they aren't meeting
those requirements yet.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:25.423
And the risk with that is that,

00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:29.110
well, the intention with
that is to motivate them

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.990
because public health officials think,

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:32.703
well, if I just tell people
you need to get more exercise

00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:35.090
because it's good for you, they'll do it.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.780
We know now that that doesn't work,

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.560
that these guidelines
are not motivational.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.810
They don't change our behavior.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:43.130
And what our work adds to that,

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:45.310
is that not only is it not motivational,

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.070
it also creates potentially a mindset

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:51.840
that makes people worse off

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.700
than they were without
knowing about the guidelines.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.420
So again, it's tricky.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.590
I'm not saying that mindset is everything.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:04.900
Certainly exercise is good
for us and is helpful for us.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.790
It's one of the things
we have the best data on.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:11.040
So I'm not saying, oh,
exercises all a placebo.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.890
What I am saying is that,
we need to be more mindful

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:17.090
about how do we motivate
people to exercise,

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.160
but how do we help people

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.440
to actually reap the
benefits of the exercise

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.870
they are already doing?

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:26.530
Now, Octavia, who is a
grad student in my lab,

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:30.790
ran a number of interesting
studies along these lines.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.810
One in which she looked at

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.130
three nationally representative data sets,

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.660
which had this interesting
question in them,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:43.590
which was how much exercise
do you get relative to others?

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.740
Do you get about the same,
a little more, a lot more,

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.860
do you get a little less
or a lot less, right?

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.040
So, the audience, your listeners,

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.790
you could all answer this.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.570
And then in these datasets, what she did,

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.010
was she had pulled from data
that tracked death rates

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.090
over the next 21 years.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:05.460
And a couple interesting
things revealed themselves.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.390
One was that,

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:09.860
the correlations between
these perceptions of exercise

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.130
relative to others, and
people's actual exercise

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:16.580
as measured through accelerometer data,

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.760
as well as more rigorous sort
of what did you do today,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.430
kind of data.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.830
Those don't correlate much at all.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:25.060
- People lie.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.070
- Well, people lie, but also...

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.903
- Or misperceive.

00:36:26.903 --> 00:36:28.520
- ...They misperceive.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.580
Or who's to say, it's misperceiving,

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.123
everything's relative, right?

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.100
I used to do triathlons very seriously.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.320
So if you were to ask me now,

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.333
I feel like I'm totally inactive, right?

00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:42.890
Because I'm not doing
anything near what I used to.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:45.990
And if that's my focus set, right?

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:49.000
I feel like I'm not exercising much.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.110
But if I think about, you
know, compared to other people,

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:56.700
given what I know about national
representative statistics,

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.680
and I could feel like, oh,
I'm getting a lot, right?

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.310
So you can see how these perceptions

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:07.310
are decoupled from objective reality.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.020
And what we found in these studies,

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:14.220
is that, that one question mattered

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.040
in some cases, more
than objective activity,

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.020
but in all cases controlling
for objective activity

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.270
and predicting death rates.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.350
And in one of the samples,

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:28.440
it was a 71% higher risk of death rate.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.180
You know, if people rated themselves

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.410
as feeling like they were getting
less activity than others.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:34.243
- Wow.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:36.431
That's a big deal.

00:37:36.431 --> 00:37:37.380
- It's a big deal.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.550
And again, that study is
cross-sectional, longitudinal,

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:41.933
it was not experimental.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.060
But combined, these really
sort of coalesced to say,

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.760
Hey, this is important too, right?

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.380
Like, let's figure out ways to be active

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.490
and get people active,

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:57.660
but let's also not make
people feel horrible

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.630
about themselves when
they're not getting enough.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.170
And going back to the hotel study again,

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.670
I mentioned that I did that at a time

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:08.090
when I was a division one ice
hockey player at the time.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:09.870
We were training all the time.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.340
And I was in an unhealthy
mindset about that,

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.160
I never felt like I was getting enough.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.150
I would come off a two hour practice

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.780
into a weightlifting session.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.850
And then I would get on the
elliptical for 30 minutes,

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:26.013
'cause I thought I had to do that also.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.060
My teammates who were with me at the time

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.370
could attest to that.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:33.170
And so, that study was
really helpful for me,

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.830
to realize that I needed pay attention,

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.160
not just to what I was doing,

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.433
but also take care of
my mindset about that.

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.560
And I think the essence
is how do you get people

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.140
to feel like they're getting enough?

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.050
It's a sense of enoughness
that really matters.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:49.100
- Yeah, I can see the dilemma

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.000
because you don't want people thinking

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:56.920
that exercise and its
positive effects are so potent

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.600
that they can get away with
a three minute walk each day.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.303
And that they're good because
most likely they are not.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.260
But again, you don't want them

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.290
to be so back on their
heels psychologically

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:14.970
that they don't even do that
or that they never exceed that

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.510
by very much.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:20.230
But it seems like the message
from the milkshake study

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.230
and what we're talking about
now in terms of exercise

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.290
would be to really communicate
to the general public

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.143
that food has a potency,

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.970
even healthy foods have a
potency to give us energy,

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:36.230
to fuel our immune system and
endocrine system, et cetera.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.710
And that exercise has
a remarkable potency,

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.040
and that that potency can be enhanced

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.110
by believing in or
understanding that potency.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:46.030
- Exactly.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.690
- Is that an accurate way to state it?

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.077
- Totally, that's exactly right.

00:39:49.077 --> 00:39:52.990
And that's where I really
feel like we need to push.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.810
And what I try to do in our research,

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.760
is to not just show, oh, mindset matters,

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.593
isn't that interesting?

00:39:57.593 --> 00:40:00.883
But it both matter, right?

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.100
Both exercise and what
you think about it matter.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.020
Both what you eat

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.530
and how you think about
what you eat matter.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.790
And so, we really, as
individuals and as a society

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:15.440
need to work on, what is
the right way to cultivate

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.720
both behaviors and mindsets

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.920
about those behaviors that serve us?

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.500
And in the food context, this--

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.990
Again, that milkshake
study really changed me

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.010
on a personal level,

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.590
because I had been somebody

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:32.303
who was constantly trying to
restrain my eating, right?

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.200
I wanted to maintain or
lose weight, look fit.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.340
And so, I was like, well, I should diet

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.460
and I should have low calorie, low carb.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.293
Low this, low that.

00:40:42.293 --> 00:40:43.510
But what that was doing,

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:47.640
was putting me into this
constant mindset of restraint.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.250
And what that study suggested,

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:54.840
was that that mindset was
potentially counteracting

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.840
any benefit or any objective
effects of the restrained diet.

00:41:01.133 --> 00:41:03.940
Because my brain was saying,
okay, you're restraining.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.850
Maybe my body was responding to that.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:10.560
But the brain was also
saying, eat more food,

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.340
stay hungry 'cause you need to survive.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.980
And so, the answer isn't,

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.950
oh, we'll throw everything into the wind

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.600
and just drink indulgent
milkshakes all day long.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:25.600
The answer is, eat healthy foods, right?

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.250
Based on the latest science

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.460
and what we know to be
true about nutrients

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.350
and our body's response to them,

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.620
but try to do so in a mindset indulgence,

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:38.280
a mindset of satisfaction, a
mindset of enjoyment, right?

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.040
That is really the trick.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.030
And that's what I at least
try to do in my own life.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.140
- I love that, and as I get more involved

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.460
in the anti-public facing
health communications,

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.910
this comes up again and again, you know,

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.940
how should we conceptualize our behavior?

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.170
How should we think
about all these options

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.080
that are offered to us?

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.820
And I'm excited that
the potency of mindsets

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.280
are coming through again and again.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.440
So, I have a question about this.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.620
I don't know if this
study has ever been done,

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.970
but a lot of these mindset effects

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:08.610
are something that years ago,

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.950
I felt I did vis-a-vis sleep.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:15.270
Because I was in graduate
school, and as a postdoc,

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.600
and even as an undergraduate,
I had so much work to do

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.950
that I decided I would
sleep when I was "dead".

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.320
Not a good idea from what we know.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:28.250
However, I found that a
couple nights of minimal sleep

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.490
or even an all-nighter and
I could do pretty well.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:32.330
Eventually it would catch up with me.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.330
Has there ever been a study

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:36.700
exploring whether or not the
effects of sleep deprivation

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.180
can be impacted by these mindset effects?

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.190
Because over the years, I
keep learning more and more

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.310
about how much sleep I need
and I've really emphasized it,

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.440
but I do feel much better
when I'm getting it.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.610
But as new parents know,

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.460
or students know or athletes know

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.320
or anyone that lives a normal life

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.780
find sometimes that they don't
get a good night's sleep.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.780
Would believing that we can tolerate that

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.940
and push through it
and function just fine,

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.690
and that it's not going to
kill us or give us Alzheimer's.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.390
Could that help us deal
with a poor night's sleep

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:10.460
or even two or chronic sleep deprivation?

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.320
- Certainly I would guess.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:16.214
There's been one study to my
knowledge that's tested that.

00:43:16.214 --> 00:43:19.770
[indistinct] and colleagues,
and they looked at--

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.520
They had people come in and they gave them

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.540
sort of a, I think it was
a sham sort of EEG test

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.700
to figure out how--

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.150
This was done a number of years ago.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.720
Now we actually have devices to test this,

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.700
but there's was this sham test.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.210
And then they gave people fake feedback

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.720
about the quality of their sleep

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.520
and how it had been the night before.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.870
And they also asked the participants

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:48.500
how they felt about their sleep.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:53.500
And essentially what they found
was that this sham feedback,

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.260
if they were told that they had gotten

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.810
and let lower quality sleep

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:02.300
led to deficits in variety
of cognitive tasks.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.940
And that was sort of decoupled

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.640
from their actual [laughs]
qualities of sleep,

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.280
at least as self-reported.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.483
So that's one study that attest
to this, I think certainly,

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:17.780
I would bet a lot of money,
I haven't run those myself,

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.780
but that your mindsets can push around

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:25.550
your cognitive functioning,
physiological effects of sleep.

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.550
But once again, it's not
all or nothing, right?

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:31.490
There are real important
benefits of sleep,

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:35.360
and how far we can push around
that through our mindset,

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.740
is an open question.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.300
- You know what?

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.820
The result that you mentioned
is really interesting

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.110
because a lot of people use
these sleep trackers now.

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:43.850
They're using rings or wristbands.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:45.330
In fact, my lab has worked pretty closely

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.230
with a company that they supplied us data

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:48.580
on how well people are sleeping,

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.340
and you get a score,
people get the score back.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.880
When they see that score,

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.530
they might think based on these results,

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.620
oh, my recovery score,
my sleep score is poor.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.500
I shouldn't expect much from myself today,

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.640
or it makes sense that
my memory would be going.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.490
For this reason,

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:05.230
and I'll probably lose a
few friends for saying this,

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:06.620
but hopefully I'll gain a few as well.

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:11.100
That's why I like to just do
a subjective score for myself.

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:11.970
If I wake up in the morning,

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.570
I just decide, okay,
did I sleep well or not?

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.000
I don't like seeing a number.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
I don't like getting a
readout from a device.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.670
That's me, I know a lot of people like it,

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:21.810
and they can be very useful.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:24.560
But gosh, it seems that
these belief effects

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.433
are weaving in at all levels.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.100
I'd love for us to talk about stress,

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.590
because your lab has
worked extensively on this.

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:35.680
And if you would, could you tell us

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.600
at some point about the
study that you've done

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.530
about informing people

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.670
about the different effects of stress.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.460
But also, if there's an opportunity,

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.310
some takeaways about how we
could each conceptualize stress

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:52.360
in ways that would make it serve us better

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.590
as opposed to harm us

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.640
and our mental and physical performance.

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.380
- Great, yeah, so I'd come off the heels

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:03.380
of doing some research
in exercise and diet

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.260
and finding these provocative

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.940
and also counterintuitive effects

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:13.120
with respect to how we should
try to motivate people, right?

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.540
And, as I was thinking about this,

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:21.540
and this grouping of going
from medicines to saving us

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.660
to behaviors to saving us,

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:27.750
and how those behaviors might
be influenced by mindsets.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:31.203
The obvious next thing to
think about with stress, right?

00:46:31.203 --> 00:46:32.500
Because it's like, okay,

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.240
well you want to be
healthier and fix your diet,

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.260
fix your exercise and stress less.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.150
And so I started doing some digging

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:41.720
into the nature of stress

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.770
and a couple things were clear.

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:46.640
One was that the public health message

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.050
was very clear, right?

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:50.190
That stress was bad, right?

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:55.180
Unmitigated and harmful on our health,

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.560
our productivity, our
relationships, our fertility,

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.547
our cognition, you name it, right?

00:47:01.547 --> 00:47:04.600
And the messages that were out there,

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.380
by and large over-simplified messages

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:11.260
focused on the damaging
consequences of stress.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.900
But as you know, if you
actually dive deeper

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.870
into the literature on stress
and the origins of stress,

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.530
what you find is that, the
literature like most literatures

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:21.790
is not so clear cut.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.740
And in fact, there's a
large amount of evidence

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:28.580
to support the fact that
the experience of stress,

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.250
meaning encountering
adversity or challenge

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.453
in one's goal related efforts,

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:37.300
does not have to be debilitating.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.590
And in many cases, the body's response

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:42.030
was designed to enhance our ability

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:44.570
to manage at those moments, right?

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:48.700
So some research showing that
stress narrows our focus,

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.130
increases our attention,

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:51.190
speeds up the rate

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:53.400
at which we're able to
process information.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.790
There was some research out there

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:59.300
showing this phenomenon of
physiological toughening,

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.470
the process by which the
release of catabolic hormones

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:03.680
and the stress response

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.130
recruit or activate anabolic hormones,

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:08.780
which help as you know build our muscles,

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:12.640
build our neurons, to
help us grow and learn.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.620
And there was a whole
body of emerging research

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.820
on post-traumatic growth

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.380
or this phenomenon in
which even the experience

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.530
of the most traumatic stressors,

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:24.420
the most chronic and enduring stressors,

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.480
could lead not to destruction,

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.310
but in fact, to the exact opposite,

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:32.960
to an enhanced sense of
connection with our values,

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:37.960
connection to others, sense
of joy and passion for living.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:42.790
And so, I found that to be interesting.

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:47.580
And my work since then has
been not to try to argue

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.850
that stress is enhancing
and not debilitating,

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:54.030
but try to point out that
the true nature of stress

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:55.060
is a paradox.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.690
The true nature of stress
is manifold and complex,

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:01.200
and lots of things can happen.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.250
But to question, what's the
role of our mindset about stress

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.230
in shaping our response to stress.

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.510
So some work had already been done

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:14.020
looking at your perception
of the stressor, right?

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:17.770
So, do you view a stressor
like a challenging exam

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:20.940
or a health diagnosis as
a challenge or a threat.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:23.800
And that had shown pretty convincingly

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.290
that when you view stressors
more as a challenge,

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:27.550
less as a threat,

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:32.550
that your brain and body
responds more adaptively.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.610
What our question was,

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:36.560
was to take the sort of
psychological construal

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.560
one step higher in abstraction.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.483
So not just the stressor, but
the nature of stress, right?

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:45.150
At that core level,

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:48.150
do you view stress as
something that's bad,

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:50.750
is going to kill us and
therefore should be avoided,

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:54.080
or do you view some stress as natural

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.770
and something that's going to enhance us?

00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:00.050
And so, we set out to
design a series of studies

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:01.140
to test the extent

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.493
to which these mindsets
about stress mattered.

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:06.560
We first, this again

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.410
was with Peter Salovey and
Shawn Achor, originally.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.580
We designed a measure to
test people's mindsets

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.413
about stress.

00:50:14.413 --> 00:50:18.110
Simple questions like,
what extent do you believe

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:21.020
or agree or disagree with statements like,

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.900
stress enhances my
performance and productivity.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.900
Stress heightens my vitality
and growth, things like that.

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:32.180
And we found in a number
of correlational studies

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.560
that a more enhancing stress mindset

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.760
was linked to better health outcomes,

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.340
better wellbeing and higher performance.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.173
So then we set out

00:50:42.173 --> 00:50:45.230
to see if we could
change people's mindsets.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.880
And in our first test of
this, we decided to do so

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.610
by creating these multimedia films

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:54.810
that showcased research, anecdotes,

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:58.080
facts about stress, all true,

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.690
but oriented towards one
mindset or the other, right?

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.400
So you can imagine one set of films

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.350
showed basically the
messages that were out there

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:08.000
in the public health context.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.240
The other showed,

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:14.070
Hey, you know, stress has
been linked to these things,

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.690
but in fact, the body's stress response

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:16.810
was designed to do this.

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:17.850
Did you know it could do that?

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:20.500
And we had empowering images

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.940
like LeBron James making the
free-throw in the final minute

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.400
versus missing it, right?

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.710
So all of these things
are true possibilities

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:32.680
but oriented to two different
mindsets about stress.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.960
- So either people saw a video
that basically made it seem

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.690
like stress will diminish
you, crush you, reduce you,

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.910
or a video very similar,
stress will grow you,

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:44.030
bring out your best,

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.960
and maybe even take you to
heightened levels of performance

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.620
that you've never experienced before.

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:49.960
- Exactly, exactly.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.820
So, yeah, examples in the sports,

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.090
we also had like true leaders emerge

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:57.020
in the moments of greatest
stress, you know, Churchill.

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.440
And so, all those examples are out there

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.410
for both the enhancing nature
and the debilitating nature.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:04.300
And our question was,

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:07.250
does orienting people
to different mindsets

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.610
change how they respond to stress?

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:10.680
So this study was done

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.450
in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:19.240
We worked with UBS, a
financial service company

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.340
that was undergoing pretty
massive amounts of layoffs.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.670
So these employees were
stressed about being laid off.

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:27.490
They were taking on more pressure.

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:29.210
It was just a tough time.

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:32.770
And we randomized them
into three conditions.

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:37.620
And this was all pre-work before
getting training on stress,

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:40.990
but the three different
conditions, some watched no videos,

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:43.530
some watched the stressful crushy videos

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:47.170
and some watched the stress
could enhance you videos.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:49.500
And what we found was that just--

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.810
It was a total of nine minutes of videos

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:53.240
over the course of the week,

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.050
led to changes in their
mindsets about stress,

00:52:56.050 --> 00:53:00.250
which led to changes in
their physiological symptoms

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:01.560
associated with stress.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.930
So people who watched the enhancing films

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:07.950
had fewer backaches,
muscle tension, insomnia,

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:09.890
racing heart, and so forth.

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:14.010
And they also reported
performing better at work

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:16.910
compared to those who watched
the debilitating videos.

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:19.250
Now interestingly, we
didn't make anyone worse

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:20.620
with the debilitating videos.

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.680
- Wow, that's good.
- Which was good.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.323
We were told that the
IRB we didn't expect that

00:53:25.323 --> 00:53:27.960
because that message
was already out there,

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.280
that's what they were already seeing,

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.140
that wasn't new to them.

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:33.990
It was more of this enhancing perspective

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:37.370
that turned out to be inspiring.

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:38.670
- I love that study, and I know

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:41.620
we both have friends and ties

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.210
in the special operations community

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:45.360
through just sort of happenstance

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.840
and maybe we'll get into
that a little later,

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.370
but a good friend from
that community always says,

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:54.190
there are only three ways to
go through life at any moment,

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:55.520
which is either back on your heels,

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.590
flat-footed or forward center of mass.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:53:58.550
And I said, well, well,

00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:00.160
what's the key to forward center of mass?

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.857
And he said, "Stress is what places you

00:54:01.857 --> 00:54:03.410
"in forward center of mass,"

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.480
meaning leaning forward
and into challenge.

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.830
And I know that you've actually
looked at that community

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:08.870
and it does really seem

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:11.830
like that's a mindset that
either they have going in

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:15.210
or that they cultivate through
the course of their training.

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.260
But this notion

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:20.050
that stress is what puts
us in forward motion,

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:21.740
is true physiologically, right?

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.340
I mean, adrenaline's major role

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.280
is to place us into a moment of,

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.501
or bias us towards action,
that's why we tremble.

00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:30.430
It's the body trying to initiate action.

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:33.180
But actually this is
probably a good opportunity.

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.270
If there was anything interesting

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:38.840
to extract from the study
on SEAL teams, what was it?

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.873
- Yeah, no, I loved
working with the SEALs.

00:54:43.447 --> 00:54:45.076
And one of the interesting
things we found,

00:54:45.076 --> 00:54:49.600
so we've studied this,
measured this mindset

00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.200
in several different populations.

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.330
And in every single one
that we have tested so far,

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:58.550
the average had been on the
debilitating side of the scale.

00:54:58.550 --> 00:54:59.800
- People just saying stress is bad.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.233
- Stress is bad, right?

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.070
Like with measures of
growth and fixed mindsets

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:09.250
about intelligence,
people are in the middle,

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:11.480
but oftentimes have a
more positive mindsets

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.040
about intelligence.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.610
That was not the case
with stress, [chuckles].

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:15.910
It's still not the case.

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:17.570
I'm trying to get the message out there.

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:20.330
Except for this group of Navy SEALs.

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:22.420
When they were actually recruit,

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.670
so people who were going
through basic training

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:26.920
in order to become Navy SEALs.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.520
And we found that they on average

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.160
had stresses enhancing mindset,

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.670
perhaps not surprisingly, right?

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:35.503
If you're going in

00:55:35.503 --> 00:55:38.860
to devote your whole life
to being a Navy SEAL,

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:40.380
you must have some inclination

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:44.370
that stress is a source
of strength for you.

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:45.460
But what we found with them,

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:48.510
we measured this at the beginning
of their basic training,

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:49.590
of buds training,

00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:52.810
and then looked at how well they succeeded

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:53.710
through that program.

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:57.690
So as you know, this is an
extremely rigorous program.

00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:01.390
At the time it was only
like 10 or 20% of trainees.

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:05.560
- Still is, the numbers have
never shifted from about that.

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:09.110
No matter how hard pressures
on the community change,

00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:11.720
the numbers are still about
on average, about 15%.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:12.553
- Yeah, wow.

00:56:12.553 --> 00:56:17.060
So, what we found was that our
measure predicted that rate.

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.270
So people even within that range

00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:21.050
had a more stresses enhancing mindset

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:24.170
were more likely to complete
training, become a SEAL.

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:26.920
They also had faster
obstacle course times,

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.619
and they were rated by
their peers more positively.

00:56:30.619 --> 00:56:34.370
So, again, let's break this down, right?

00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:38.640
This doesn't mean, and people
get this wrong sometimes.

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.103
They think that I'm saying,

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.510
that a stresses enhancing mindset

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:44.690
means you should stress, right?

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:46.860
Well, maybe SEALs do.

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.620
But that's not what we're saying, right?

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.420
Having a stresses enhancing mindset

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.660
doesn't mean the stressor
is a good thing, right?

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.060
It doesn't mean it's a good thing

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:59.370
that you have to go into combat
and it's not pretty, right?

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:00.203
It doesn't mean

00:57:00.203 --> 00:57:03.630
that getting a cancer
diagnosis is a good thing

00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:05.560
or being an abject
poverty is a good thing.

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.470
These are not good things.

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:10.510
But the experience of the
stress associated with that,

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:12.530
the challenge, the adversity,

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:17.530
that experience can lead
to and enhancing outcomes

00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:21.050
with respect to not just our cognition,

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:24.040
but our health, our
performance and our wellbeing.

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.850
So that mindset, right?

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:27.570
How does that work, right?

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:30.770
Well, it works through a
number of different pathways.

00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:32.940
One is that it changes fundamentally

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.770
what we're motivated to do.

00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:39.060
So if you just imagine we're
stressed about something,

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.367
maybe a global pandemic, for example.

00:57:41.367 --> 00:57:42.238
- For instance.

00:57:42.238 --> 00:57:43.488
- For instance.

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:48.140
And you think that stress is bad,

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.150
then what's your motivation, right?

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:51.780
Your motivation is to,

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.190
well, first you get worried
about the stress, right?

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:55.670
Now not only do you have the pandemic,

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:58.030
you're stressed about the
stress of the pandemic.

00:57:58.030 --> 00:57:58.863
But second is,

00:57:58.863 --> 00:58:00.990
your reaction is typically
to do one of two things.

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:04.470
It's either to freak out
and do everything you can

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:07.530
to make sure that this
doesn't affect you negatively,

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:10.337
or to check out and say,
oh, it's not a big deal.

00:58:10.337 --> 00:58:11.230
I'm not going to deal with that.

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:12.780
You're basically in denial.

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:15.750
So, people who have a
stresses debilitating mindset

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:17.400
and we've shown this in our research,

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.750
tend to go to one of the
other of those extremes.

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:22.270
They freak out, or they check out, why?

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:25.210
Because if stress is bad you
need to either get rid of it

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:28.260
and deal with it or it
needs to not exist, right?

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.810
If you have a stressors enhancing mindset,

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:32.400
the motivation changes, right?

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:36.400
Then the motivation is,
how do I utilize the stress

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.700
to realize the enhancing outcomes?

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.650
What can we do here, right?

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:45.650
To learn from this experience,
to make us stronger, fitter,

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:50.010
have better science and
treatments for the future,

00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:53.000
deepen my relationships with others,

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.580
improve my priorities and so forth, right?

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:59.570
So the motivation changes,
the affect around it changes,

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:01.580
it doesn't make it easy to deal with.

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:03.870
But what we've shown in
our research is that,

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:05.770
people who have a
stresses enhancing mindset

00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:07.500
have more positive effect,

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.620
not necessarily less negative effect,

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:13.250
and it potentially changes physiology.

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:16.520
We have a few studies that show that

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:21.520
people who are inspired to
adopt more enhancing mindsets,

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.280
have more moderate cortisol response,

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:28.050
and they have higher levels of DHA levels

00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:29.240
in response to stress.

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:32.080
So, more work needs to be
done on the physiology,

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:35.590
but I'd love your take on the mechanisms

00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:37.110
through which that's possible.

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:40.900
- Yes, and DHA of course
is an anabolic hormone

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:42.400
in both men and women.

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.340
Very interesting, because we
had a guest on this podcast.

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.540
He actually he's a PhD scientist

00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:51.790
who runs the UFC Performance
Training Institute,

00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:53.340
his name is Duncan French.

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.420
And his graduate work at Yukon
stores was very interesting.

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.840
It was in exercise science and physiology.

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.630
What he showed was that,

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.020
if you could spike the
adrenaline response...

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.010
I think they did this
through first time skydive

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:06.293
or something like that.

01:00:06.293 --> 01:00:09.240
...That testosterone went up.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.810
Now, this spits in the face

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:13.960
of everything that we're told about stress

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.820
and testosterone levels, right?

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:19.620
And this has also been looked
at in females with estrogen.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:22.390
Although of course, there's
estrogen and testosterone,

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:23.310
both males and females,

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:24.890
but that's how they
had designed the study.

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:27.900
So it turns out that at
least in the short term,

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.810
that a very stressful event
can raise anabolic hormones.

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:35.980
And I think that people
forget at a mechanistic level

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.943
that adrenaline is epinephrin,

01:00:37.943 --> 01:00:40.970
and epinephrin is biochemically derived

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.710
from the molecule dopamine.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:43.720
If you look at the pathway,

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.300
and even just Google it and go images,

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.070
you'll see that adrenaline
is made from dopamine.

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:52.162
And dopamine and these anabolic hormones

01:00:52.162 --> 01:00:53.140
they're sort of close cousins.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.490
They work together in the
pituitary and hypothalamus.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:59.970
So it makes sense that
one could leverage stress

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:01.870
toward growth,

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:04.710
and towards anibalism as
opposed to cannibalism,

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:07.380
which is not saying cannibalism
as in eating other people,

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.850
but catabolic processes,

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:11.760
is I guess, the right way to refer to it.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.300
But what's again remarkable to me,

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:14.760
is that all of these brain structures

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.900
that control dopamine, epinephrin,

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.260
testosterone and estrogen,

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.930
they're all thought to
be in the subconscious,

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:24.280
meaning below our ability to flip a switch

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.830
and turn them on or off.
- [Alia] Right.

01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:28.280
- And yet mindset seemed to impact them.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.980
So I've all that to say,

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:34.010
that there's a clear mechanistic basis

01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:35.493
by which this could all work.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.750
So on the one hand I'm surprised,

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:40.450
because these are incredible results.

01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:41.730
On the other hand, I'm not surprised

01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:43.410
because there's a
physiological substrate there

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:45.320
that could readily explain them.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.040
- Yeah, and I think figuring
out exactly how it works

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.140
is really, [chuckles].

01:01:51.118 --> 01:01:52.040
- We should do that.
- We should do that.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.050
- We should collaborate.
- Let's do it.

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:54.810
- We've got common friends
in both departments,

01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:56.240
so we should do it.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.640
- But I did want to mention,

01:01:59.509 --> 01:02:00.730
the way I think about mindset,

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:03.180
and again, I think we need to study this.

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.240
I'm not a neuroscientist,
so I haven't looked at this,

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.150
but this is something we could do.

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:08.900
But the way I think about mindset,

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.820
is that mindsets are kind of a portal

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:16.370
between conscious and
subconscious processes.

01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:20.930
They operate as a default
setting of the mind, right?

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:25.760
So, if sort of programmed in there,

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.593
you have stress equals bad, right?

01:02:32.997 --> 01:02:36.030
That is going to be something
maybe conscious, right?

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:38.820
But it doesn't have to
be conscious, right?

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.880
People don't have to know
their mindsets about stress

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.443
until they're asked really.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.230
That's been programmed in
through our upbringing,

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:49.460
through public health
messages and through media

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.500
and other things.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.360
And it kind of sits there as
an assumption in the brain,

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.590
and the brain is then figuring out

01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:59.330
how should it respond to this situation?

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:01.040
And if the assumption, the default,

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.270
the programming is, stress is bad,

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:07.280
that's going to, through
our subconscious trigger,

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.270
all the things that's like,

01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:13.270
okay, well, I need to rev up
the things that protect me

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:16.340
versus rev up the things
that help me grow.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.270
And so, that's at least
how I think about it.

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:22.030
And what's cool about it is that,

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:24.250
because it operates as a sort of portal,

01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:26.510
it communicates with more

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:28.970
subconscious physiological processes,

01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:30.520
but it can also be accessed

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.080
through our consciousness, right?

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.900
So just talking about this, right?

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.800
For your listeners, they're now invited

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.110
to bring their stress mindsets
up to the consciousness

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.220
and say, what is my stress mindset?

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.020
How am I thinking about stress?

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.630
Can I reprogram that?

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:51.190
Can I start to think about
it as more enhancing?

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:54.250
That takes a little bit of a
conscious work potentially,

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:56.630
but then once you do that,

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:59.100
that can kind of operate
in the background,

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:00.920
influencing how your body responds

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.560
and you don't have to
say, okay, I'm stressed,

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.002
I better tell my anabolic hormones.

01:04:06.002 --> 01:04:07.560
- Right, right.
- That doesn't work that way.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.460
- No.

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.290
- But these mindsets can help

01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:12.540
with the translational process.

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.660
- I love the idea that
mindsets are at the interface

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.770
between the conscious and subconscious.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:20.150
And I think there's a lot to unpack there.

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:25.150
But it clearly is the
case, that the mindset,

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.670
they sort of act as heuristics, right?

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:29.060
And as we talked about earlier,

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.660
they can limit what the
number of things to focus on.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.470
Because one thing that is really stressful

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.352
is trying to focus on
everything all the time.

01:04:35.352 --> 01:04:37.010
I've been trying to
navigate the public health

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:38.630
around anything.

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:40.100
The public health
information around anything

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:40.933
it's kind of overwhelming.

01:04:40.933 --> 01:04:42.010
As you mentioned for stress,

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:44.060
you see a lot in the
stresses will crush you,

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.930
and then you can also find evidence

01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:47.363
that stress will grow you.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.470
How should we, the
listeners, think about stress

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:57.280
and what's the most adaptive
way to think about stress?

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.330
And should we talk about our stress?

01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:01.233
Should we not talk about our stress?

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.160
Is there a short list

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.910
of ways that we can
cope with stress better?

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:08.030
- Yeah.

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:09.170
- I should be careful with the word cope.

01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:12.480
Is there a way that we can
leverage stress to our advantage?

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.930
- Great, yeah, and that's
an important nuance

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:19.350
in your language, which
people have by and large

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:21.740
come from a place of how
do you manage stress?

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:22.760
How do you cope with it?

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.520
Which implies, how do you
fight against it, right?

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.330
- Vacation, massages, yoga classes.

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:31.094
- Fight against or check
out from it, right?

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.080
- Exactly, exactly.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.310
- And yeah, the real challenge
is, how do we leverage it?

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:36.650
How do we utilize it?

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:38.680
How do we work with it?

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.630
And yeah, I have a lot
of thoughts on this.

01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:42.770
The first and most important thing

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:47.320
is to clarify our definition of stress.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.230
So I think people often associate--

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:54.237
The negative stress
mindset is so insidious,

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:58.120
that now people define stress

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.560
with its negative consequences.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.507
So the first step is to decouple that,

01:06:02.507 --> 01:06:06.853
and to realize that stress
is a neutral, right?

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.150
Yet to be determined effect

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:14.840
of experiencing or anticipating adversity

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.880
in your goal related efforts.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.540
So let me unpack that a little more,

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:20.520
you can be in the midst of it,

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.510
or you could just be worried
about something happening.

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:24.950
That's one aspect.

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:27.340
Second is, adversity or challenge,

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.910
or something that's working against you.

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:31.520
But the third piece is critical,

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.770
and that is in your goal related efforts.

01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:36.040
What that means is that,

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.450
we only stress about things we care about,

01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:41.750
things that matter to us.

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:44.830
So this is really important, right?

01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:49.020
Because stress is linked with,

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.430
it's the other side of the coin

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:53.480
of things we care about, right?

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.950
And so, I think that's the
first thing to realize, right?

01:06:56.950 --> 01:07:01.950
That as humans, we stress because we care,

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:06.360
and we don't stress about
things we don't care about.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.230
So the simplified
example I like to use is,

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:12.710
you know, if Johnny was failing school,

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:14.330
that wouldn't stress you out,

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:18.680
unless Johnny was your
son or you were Johnny,

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.490
or you really cared about

01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:22.300
educating the Johnny's
of the world, right?

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.710
It only becomes stressful

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.870
to the extent that you care about it.

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:29.930
So, why are we trying to fight or run away

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:32.100
or hide or merely cope with our stress

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.940
or overcome it through our massages,

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:39.940
when the stress is connected
to the things we care about.

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:43.330
So then the question becomes,
okay, if that's true,

01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:47.370
how can I better utilize or leverage

01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:50.800
or respond to the inevitable stresses

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.860
that we're going to experience?

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:55.560
I'm not saying go out
and seek out more stress.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.890
What I am saying is that, you're
going to experience stress

01:07:57.890 --> 01:08:00.120
if you have any cares
or values or passions

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.123
and most all of us do.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:05.230
And so, then what do you do?

01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:08.120
And we've developed a three-step approach

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.530
to adopting a stresses enhancing mindset,

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:12.830
and briefly, the first step

01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:15.450
is to just acknowledge
that you're stressed,

01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:20.450
to own it, see it, be mindful of it.

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.963
The second step is to welcome it.

01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:25.250
Why would you welcome it?

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:28.630
You welcome it because
inherently in that stress

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:30.300
is something you care about.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.180
So you're using it as an opportunity

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:35.790
to reconnect to what is
it that I care about here?

01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:39.720
And then the third step is to
utilize the stress response,

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:43.140
to achieve the thing that you care about,

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.940
not spend your time,
money, effort, energy,

01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:48.740
trying to get rid of the stress.

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.573
Does that make sense?

01:08:49.573 --> 01:08:51.040
- Makes sense and I love it.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.360
As somebody who's laboratory studies,

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.826
the physiological effects of stress,

01:08:53.826 --> 01:08:56.310
the effects that impressed me the most

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:59.980
are for instance, the
narrowing of visual attention,

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:04.980
that it then drives a capacity
to pass time more finely,

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.900
which then drives the capacity

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:09.220
to process information faster.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.642
It's almost like a superpower.

01:09:10.642 --> 01:09:11.475
- Right.

01:09:11.475 --> 01:09:16.475
- And yes, it can feel
uncomfortable often,

01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:20.810
but I love the idea
that, acknowledging it,

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:24.700
embracing it and then
understanding its power

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.450
and leveraging that power.

01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:29.710
I think what I like so
much about that framework

01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:32.540
is that the stress
response is very generic.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:33.920
Unlike the relaxation response,

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.100
we don't actually have to
train up the stress response.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:39.090
So we all kind of get this as a freebie.

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:40.340
And then it sounds like it's a question

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.700
of what we end up doing with that.

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.640
- Right, and Hans Selye,
father of stress said himself,

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.010
it's a nonspecific response, right?

01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:50.100
So it occurs, it's what
you're doing with it.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.720
It's how you're channeling it.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.930
And yeah, like we talked about before,

01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:57.610
what most people do is they
stress about the stress,

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.590
which then over exacerbates it,

01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:01.330
or they check out from the stress,

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:04.160
which leads to depression and anhedonia.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.970
Because by checking out from stress,

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:08.450
you're also checking out from
the things we care about.

01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:10.071
- And substance abuse.
- Exactly.

01:10:10.071 --> 01:10:11.630
- Our colleague Anna
Lembke, who also we had

01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:12.470
the good fortune

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:13.780
of having as a guest on this podcast,

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.163
talked a lot about this.

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:17.963
I mean, so much of substance abuse,

01:10:18.863 --> 01:10:20.080
because she runs the addiction clinic

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.733
over on the med side of campus.

01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:26.070
It takes over people's lives

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:28.930
because of this increased stability

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:31.860
to find a solution to the stress,

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.520
that then eventually
becomes its own stressor

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.703
and its own problem.

01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:40.230
Well, I love that mindset and framework.

01:10:40.230 --> 01:10:42.860
I'd love for you to tell us just a bit

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.360
about what you're up to right now,

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.150
and what's most exciting to you now.

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:50.700
If you are able or willing to talk

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.460
about some of the work that's on the way.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:53.840
I saw a brief mention

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.360
of something on your publications website

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.080
of a paper about influencers,

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.660
online influencers and nutrition.

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.620
Now, that might not be the main
thrust of what you're up to,

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.883
but if you're able to tell us about it,

01:11:03.883 --> 01:11:06.550
sort of interesting given that
a lot of the communication

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:09.267
in and around this podcast takes
place through social media.

01:11:09.267 --> 01:11:12.860
And I've kind of launched
into this landscape now

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:16.110
where constantly bombarded
with health information

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.392
and influencers, right?

01:11:19.392 --> 01:11:20.400
At the time I didn't even know

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.670
until couple of [mumbles].

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:22.930
- You are one.

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:24.790
- One could argue one way or the other,

01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:28.660
but what is the deal with influencers?

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:31.090
Are they doing something
good for health information

01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:33.870
or are they ruining the landscape?

01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:36.230
And don't try and protect my feelings.

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:39.830
'Cause I now know that
stress is actually an asset.

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:44.540
- Yeah, well, that work
is part of a body of work

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:47.450
that we've been sort of venturing into,

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:49.370
which is to understand

01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:51.830
where do these mindsets come from, right?

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:54.130
And I mentioned sort of
public health entities

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:58.630
as one source of, say our
mindsets about stress.

01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:00.280
But I think that our mindsets

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.370
are influenced by four different sources.

01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:08.810
First is our upbringing, how
our parents talked about,

01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:12.900
things like when we're stressed
or food or other things.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.870
Second is culture and media.

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:20.760
So movies, podcasts, and now social media.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.470
Third is influential others.

01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:30.050
So what doctors say to us
or close friends or peers.

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:32.590
And fourth is your conscious choice.

01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:34.993
So, we talked about that a little.

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.400
We have as humans have the
ability to be mindful of,

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.140
and to change our mindsets.

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:46.640
But the social media and influencer stuff

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.760
has been in part in attempt to understand

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.780
where do our mindsets

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:53.470
about things like healthy foods come from.

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:56.560
And Brad Turnwald, who was a
former grad student in my lab

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.320
has done a series of really
interesting studies on this,

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.810
showing that, if you rate
the nutritional quality

01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:07.810
of the top grossing movies
in the last 20 years,

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:10.190
or you look at the Instagram accounts

01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:14.800
of all the most influential
people on Instagram,

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.230
and you analyze the nutrition content

01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:21.030
of what they're eating,
what he's shown is that,

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.030
depending on the study,

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:26.800
70 to 90% of those movies or influencers

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:31.750
would fail the legal standards
for advertising in the UK.

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:35.410
So they're putting out
their nutrition contents

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:40.410
that are, maybe not surprisingly,
but undeniably unhealthy.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.300
And to me, that's
interesting and important.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:48.300
It shows that where are
we getting this mindset

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:53.300
that those unhealthy foods
are pleasurable, desirable.

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:55.610
What's maybe even more
interesting than that

01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:59.000
is some of the work that he
and others in our lab have done

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.750
to show that the ways people are talking

01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:04.360
about the foods they're
eating really matter too.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.980
So generally what we've found is that

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:09.930
when people talk about unhealthy foods,

01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:14.930
they use a language that
connotes a sense of excitement,

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.210
fun, sexiness, danger, indulgence,

01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:22.720
basically anything good
and desirable, right?

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.780
- These should be cookies,
cakes, high sugar.

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:28.333
- Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.000
That's actually--

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.367
The objective, what?

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:34.020
Helped me is it's challenging,

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.610
but yeah, high fat, high sugar.

01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:37.280
- Yeah, I think there's
pretty good agreement now

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.930
that excessive sugar isn't good.

01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:40.467
- Yeah, and highly processed.

01:14:40.467 --> 01:14:42.390
- Yeah, highly processed,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:43.912
I think there's general consensus.

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:44.745
I'm sure someone will--

01:14:44.745 --> 01:14:46.040
If you're going to come
after anyone come after me,

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.820
I'll stand behind [mumbles].

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:50.650
- But on the other hand, when
people are talking about,

01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:53.180
if they do, which, you know, healthy foods

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.540
aren't portrayed in media,

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:57.920
they aren't portrayed by
influencers rarely ever.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.170
And when they are,
they're often talked about

01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:04.958
with language that conveys
a sense of deprivation.

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:08.650
It's nutritious, but it's
sort of boring, it's bland.

01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:09.520
It's not tasty.
- Recovering

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.353
from the holidays.

01:15:10.353 --> 01:15:12.097
Sort of the post-holiday reset, right?

01:15:12.097 --> 01:15:14.900
- Exactly, and this is really important

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.020
because you're doing all this work trying,

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:19.110
and others are doing all this work,

01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:21.090
trying to inform people

01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:23.150
about what actually is good for them.

01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:28.030
And meanwhile, there's this
hurricane of other force

01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:33.053
that's telling people,
that seeping in our minds,

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:35.420
sure, those might be good for you,

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.430
but those foods are not
fun or sexy or indulgent

01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:41.440
or desirable in any way,
shape or form, right?

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.670
And it's also paid
advertising for fast foods

01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:47.640
and sugary beverages and other things.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:52.070
So it's not surprising
that we have this mindset,

01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:55.130
that healthy foods are the
less desirable thing to eat

01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:58.150
because of those cultural
and social forces.

01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:02.020
What our work has just tried
to do is to reveal that,

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.710
quantify it, as a way to say,

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:06.890
all right, let's maybe be
a little bit more mindful

01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:09.563
about how we talk about healthy foods.

01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:12.270
If you're a movie producer,

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:13.700
can you be a little bit more mindful

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:16.980
to showcase healthy and delicious foods

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.570
and have the characters talk about them

01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:20.540
in ways that are more appealing?

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:25.360
There's a lot of room for
people who produce this content

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.900
to have an impact, not
just on what people do,

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:31.830
but what they think about
the foods they're eating.

01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:32.700
- It's really interesting.

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:35.340
I hadn't thought about it until now,

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.440
but it makes sense that
any food that's packaging

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.580
can be sold as, can be woven into a film

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.370
or promoted by a celebrity influencer,

01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:46.980
not a health influencer per se,

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:49.720
but a celebrity influencer
because they'll get paid, right?

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:53.250
It's part of the ecosystem
that allows them an income

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:56.270
and it feeds back on sales to the company.

01:16:56.270 --> 01:17:00.550
Whereas things that can't be commoditized,

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:02.270
it's more difficult, right?

01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:07.160
It's hard to the whoever makes
oranges and sells oranges

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.540
is unlikely to promote
oranges in a celebrity post

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.630
or in a movie because
oranges can be purchased

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:15.080
from many, many sources.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.420
That there's no identifiable
source of oranges

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:21.020
as there is with a packaged
food, for instance.

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.400
- Yeah, but the interesting
thing we found in those studies

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.500
is that it wasn't driven
by promoted content

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.060
or branded content.

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:30.610
There was some of that certainly,

01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:34.520
and yeah, all of the
promoted and branded content

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.230
is usually for processed high sugar foods.

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:41.380
But 90% or more of these
foods that they were showing

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:43.290
were not promoted or branded.

01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:47.260
And so, there's a lot of flexibility

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:50.280
in what these producers or influencers

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.620
could show on their media.

01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.160
Although it goes both ways, right?

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:57.200
It's not just the producers
and the influencers

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.700
responsibility, the public
is reacting to this.

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:05.560
And we showed too that people
respond more positively,

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.130
there are more likes on
posts about unhealthy foods.

01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:15.130
So it's a sort of
distasteful and in neck it,

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:20.450
you know, it's a distasteful
culture around healthy eating

01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:23.180
and we really have a
lot to do to change it.

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.680
- Yeah, it's dopamine
circuits through and through,

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.940
just the site of some very calorie dense,

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:33.940
extremely tasty food drives
those dopamine circuits.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:38.280
And I realized that there
are people out there

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.240
who derive the same sort of,

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.597
or similar levels of
pleasure from healthy foods.

01:18:42.597 --> 01:18:44.657
And that's a wonderful thing
if one can accomplish that.

01:18:44.657 --> 01:18:46.970
So we just need more of that,
is what it's sounds like.

01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:47.803
- Yeah, exactly.

01:18:47.803 --> 01:18:49.120
And that's what's really inspiring.

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:53.250
To me at least, is that,
it is possible, right?

01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:54.250
I mean, people think, oh, well,

01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:57.290
vegetables are just inherently
less tasty than ice cream.

01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:59.610
And it's like, well, that's
not necessarily true.

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.660
Also it doesn't have to
be a competition, right?

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:05.200
I don't have to get my
three-year-old to hate ice cream

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.640
in order for it her like broccoli.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.220
There's a lot more I can be doing

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:12.990
to help shape a more
positive approach oriented,

01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:17.790
indulgent mindset around
healthy, nutritious vegetables

01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:20.460
and fruits and other foods, right?

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:22.590
In addition to having her
like ice cream, right?

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:23.967
And that's totally fine.

01:19:23.967 --> 01:19:25.317
- So, it's a really interesting study.

01:19:25.317 --> 01:19:26.423
When it's published, let me know and all.

01:19:26.423 --> 01:19:29.630
- Yeah, I think it was actually
released this week, yeah.

01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:31.960
In JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:34.480
- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:38.090
I will definitely talk
about it on social media

01:19:39.012 --> 01:19:41.080
and elsewhere, sounds very interesting.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.020
What else are you up to lately?

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:45.290
My favorite question to ask
any scientist or colleague

01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:47.990
by the way, is what are you
most excited about lately?

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.397
What are you up late thinking about

01:19:51.397 --> 01:19:53.390
and getting up early thinking about?

01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:56.220
- Yeah, so hands down, the
thing I'm most [mumbles],

01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.520
well, I guess there's so many things.

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.130
The thing that I'm most into right now,

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.910
we're doing the most work in is, you know,

01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:05.870
I started by getting
inspired by placebo effects

01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:07.180
in medicine.

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:11.240
I did a long stint in placebo
or belief like effects

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.550
in behavioral health.

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:15.500
And now we're moving back into medicine.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.200
So I'm really interested

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:21.090
in looking at how we can
work with active drugs

01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:24.020
and treatments, to make them better

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.180
and make the experience of them better

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.210
by instilling different mindsets.

01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:31.360
So, one study we did along those lines,

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.720
we worked with kids

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.610
or undergoing treatment
for food allergies.

01:20:36.610 --> 01:20:38.740
So allergies to peanuts, for example,

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.150
this was with Kari Nadeau,

01:20:40.150 --> 01:20:42.630
who's the head of the
Stanford Allergy Center here.

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:45.540
She has a great treatment
for food allergies.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:48.590
Basically kids take
gradually increasing doses

01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:51.850
of the thing they're
allergic to, like peanuts.

01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:54.570
And over the course of
six or seven months,

01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:59.570
these kids become less
reactive to peanuts.

01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:04.113
And the problem with that
treatment is it's really difficult

01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:08.170
because they're having all
sorts of negative symptoms

01:21:08.170 --> 01:21:09.420
and side effects.

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.800
These kids are getting itchy
mouths and upset stomach,

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.930
they're puking and it's scary,

01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:17.640
because they're literally eating the thing

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.190
that they've been told
might kill them, right?

01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:21.960
And what we did in the study,

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.570
was we attempted to improve the experience

01:21:24.570 --> 01:21:28.890
and outcomes of that,
by reframing mindsets

01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:31.570
about the symptoms and the side effects.

01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:34.200
So as it was being conducted before,

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.030
the kids were told,
look, these side effects

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:40.890
are just an unfortunate
by-product of this treatment,

01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:43.990
and you have to sort of
endure them to get through it.

01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:46.280
But what we found in our
conversation with Kari,

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.110
was that the reality of those side effects

01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:50.640
was not so negative.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.760
In fact, they were mechanistically linked

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.990
to the body learning
how to tolerate peanuts

01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:59.280
or the allergen.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.750
And so what we did was
we worked within a trial.

01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:04.640
They were all getting the treatment,

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:07.700
but half of them were helped to see

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:09.230
this more positive mindsets.

01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:12.240
That symptoms and side
effects from this treatment,

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.490
were a positive signal that
the treatment was working

01:22:15.490 --> 01:22:17.830
and their bodies were getting stronger.

01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:18.970
And what we found was that

01:22:18.970 --> 01:22:23.970
that mindset led to reductions
in anxiety, fewer symptoms,

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:28.770
when at the highest doses and
most interestingly of all,

01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:30.120
they had better outcomes.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.280
So based on immune markers,

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.670
that were assign of
the allergic tolerance,

01:22:34.670 --> 01:22:36.330
those who had this mindset throughout

01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:38.660
had better outcomes to the treatment.

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:40.150
So that's just one example.

01:22:40.150 --> 01:22:42.970
I think, my goal is really to move us

01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:47.970
beyond the placebo versus
drug, mindset versus behavior,

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.180
to get to a place where
we can blend them together

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.040
and maximize the benefit
of these treatments.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.610
So we're doing a lot of studies like that,

01:22:58.610 --> 01:23:01.800
you know, how can we
improve treatment for cancer

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.490
with different mindsets?

01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:07.673
We've done some work recently
with the COVID-19 vaccine,

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.300
and symptoms and side effects.

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:13.313
So that's what I'm really
passionate about right now.

01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:15.630
- It's incredible.

01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:16.810
I can't wait to read that study.

01:23:16.810 --> 01:23:18.060
Is that one out or on the way?

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.010
- Yes.

01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:22.800
- Okay, well then I will also
read and communicate with you

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:23.633
and then about that.

01:23:23.633 --> 01:23:25.360
So who knows, maybe you
would come on Instagram

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.670
and do a little Instagram live

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:31.070
to make sure that I don't
screw up the delivery

01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:32.610
and that we can hear it direct

01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:34.410
from the person who ran the study.

01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:38.460
I find this issue of side
effects really interesting.

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:40.190
I don't take a lot of prescription drugs,

01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:42.950
but recently I was prescribed a few,

01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:47.437
and the list of side
effects is, it's incredible

01:23:47.437 --> 01:23:49.280
and it just goes on and on and on.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.360
I realize some of that
is legal protections.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.193
It's hard for me to believe

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:54.510
that they're actually
expecting anyone to read those

01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:57.620
because you need a high powered
microscope to read this,

01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.520
print is truly fine print.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:02.680
But I did realize that in
reading over the side effects

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.670
that one prime is themselves,

01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:07.350
to experience those side effects.

01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:09.930
And so now I just rip up
the side effects thing

01:24:09.930 --> 01:24:11.410
or the sheet, and just throw it away.

01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:12.913
I just take it as recommended.

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:15.860
Do you think it works
in the other direction

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:19.910
to where if an effective medication

01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:23.730
is supposed to have result A, B or C,

01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:26.050
and you are told again and again,

01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:28.030
how effective it is for that treatment,

01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:29.910
that it could amplify the effect.

01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:32.930
So in other words, it's
strictly a placebo.

01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:35.620
It's not nocebo, as you described before.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:38.160
But that perhaps at a lower dose,

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.420
a given medication could
have a amplified effect

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:44.290
or at a appropriate dose, if you will,

01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:46.700
it could have a super
physiological effect.

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.300
Has that ever been demonstrated?

01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:50.643
- To some degree.

01:24:50.643 --> 01:24:53.340
I think where it gets
tricky is, for a long time,

01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:55.320
people thought the effects of placebos

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.130
were expectancy based.

01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:01.733
So you expect to get a benefit
and that benefit occurs.

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:05.010
There's certainly some,
some truth to that,

01:25:05.010 --> 01:25:08.120
but I think the mindset
approach is more powerful

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:11.010
because it helps us understand
the mechanisms, right?

01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:15.763
So if you just expect that your
blood pressure will go down,

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.650
what are the mechanisms

01:25:19.650 --> 01:25:21.150
through which that expectation

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:23.330
would lead to your blood
pressure going down way?

01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:26.320
It's hard to even understand that, right?

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.320
But if you have the mindset
that, you're in good hands,

01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:34.913
that this is being taken care of,

01:25:34.913 --> 01:25:39.490
that this illness is not
going to kill you, right?

01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:41.890
That you're being treated well.

01:25:41.890 --> 01:25:45.280
Then you can start to
unpack the mechanisms

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.030
through which blood
pressure could be relieved.

01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:49.560
Maybe it's anxiety reduction,

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.900
maybe it's changing the
sort of anticipation

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:55.650
of what are the prioritization

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:57.960
of what the body needs to focus on.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.920
And so, I really think
that, the work of the future

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:05.640
needs to be on getting
more sophisticated about

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.510
what is the mindset that we're instilling

01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:09.590
when we say something will
work or it won't work.

01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:12.260
And how do we understand the mechanisms

01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:14.740
through which that changes physiology?

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:16.090
So to answer your question,

01:26:16.090 --> 01:26:17.490
I think that that could be true,

01:26:17.490 --> 01:26:20.160
but it depends on what
actually is the mindset

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:20.993
you're evoking.

01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:23.293
- I know you're a parent,

01:26:24.357 --> 01:26:25.940
and to the other parents out there,

01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:28.700
but also the kids and
people who don't have kids,

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:32.040
what is the best way to
learn and teach mindsets?

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.980
I mean, clearly a conversation
like this informs me

01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:37.457
and many other people
out there about mindsets

01:26:37.457 --> 01:26:39.260
and how we can adopt them.

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.400
But it also seems to me

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.080
that if we have the
opportunity to teach mindsets

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.250
and really cultivate certain mindsets,

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:49.580
that the world will be
a much better place.

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.413
- Yes.

01:26:50.413 --> 01:26:51.880
- How does one go about that?

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.900
Given that there were kids
and we are all being bombarded

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.570
with conflicting information all the time,

01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:58.473
how do we anchor to a mindset?

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:04.310
- Yeah, and you're getting
at my other major passion

01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:07.040
right now, which is what
we're calling in our lab,

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.450
meta mindset.

01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:11.160
I'm working on this with
Chris Evans and others.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.100
And that is, how do we
consciously and deliberately

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.120
change our mindsets?

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.070
And the first step is really simple,

01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:22.800
and that's just to be
aware that you have them.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.240
That the world, your beliefs,

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.520
aren't sort of an unmitigated
reflection of reality

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.260
as it objectively is.

01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.870
They are filtered through
our interpretations,

01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:36.080
our expectations, our frameworks,

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.530
and simplifications of that reality.

01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:41.640
And as you know, your work
and then you're as you know,

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:45.070
so well that most of
what goes on in our brain

01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:47.700
is an interpretation of reality.

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.560
Mindsets are just the
simplified core assumptions

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.860
about things.

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:56.180
And the first step is to
realize that we have them.

01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:59.270
The second step is to
start to think about,

01:27:59.270 --> 01:28:02.300
what the effects of those
mindsets are on your life

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.220
to sort of play out the story, right?

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.580
Okay, I have this mindset
that stress is debilitating.

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:10.090
How is that making me feel?

01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:11.690
What is that leading me to do?

01:28:11.690 --> 01:28:15.000
Is this mindset helpful or harmful?

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.270
The question isn't is the
mindset right or wrong?

01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:20.210
Because you can find
evidence for her against it.

01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:23.230
We can fight about it
until we're exhausted.

01:28:23.230 --> 01:28:26.950
The question is, is it helpful or harmful?

01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:31.090
And then, you can go
about seeking out ways

01:28:31.090 --> 01:28:34.880
to adopt more useful mindsets.

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.960
So, we've been doing a lot of work

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.310
on how to actually do that.

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:39.990
How do you consciously change it?

01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:42.330
Sometimes it's really simple.

01:28:42.330 --> 01:28:43.330
I think in cases

01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:45.210
where we don't have a
lot of prior experience,

01:28:45.210 --> 01:28:49.933
like the kids with allergies
who are getting treatment,

01:28:51.348 --> 01:28:53.910
they didn't have any other
mindsets about symptoms.

01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:57.070
So we just had the luxury
of setting it, right?

01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:58.700
When it comes to healthy food,

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.963
I think it's harder to
change people's mindsets

01:29:00.963 --> 01:29:04.143
because we have a lot of
baggage weighing us down.

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.660
As a parent, for me,

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:12.660
I guess my number one piece
of advice is to lighten up,

01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:16.820
trying to get your kids
to do certain things

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:19.800
and focus more on helping them to adopt

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:22.090
more adaptive mindsets.

01:29:22.090 --> 01:29:25.500
So, I'm by no means an expert at this,

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.167
but I'm testing it with my own child.

01:29:27.167 --> 01:29:29.150
- Your child real, real child.

01:29:29.150 --> 01:29:31.460
The real kind of experiment.

01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:34.910
- It's how do I resist the urge

01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:37.280
to force my child to eat her dinner

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.413
so that she can have her dessert, right?

01:29:39.413 --> 01:29:40.950
Because that's the real urge.

01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:41.810
It's like, no, you need
- Or you're negotiating.

01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:42.960
- to do that.

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.960
Because when you start thinking about it

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:48.220
in terms of mindset, you realize, oh,

01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:50.310
that's just reinforcing to her,

01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:53.570
that the dessert is the
exciting, fun thing to have.

01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:56.320
And this thing that I have
to do must be horrible.

01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:00.450
So horrible that my parent is
forcing me to do it, right?

01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:04.620
So it's letting go a
little bit of the behavior,

01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:05.940
the objective reality,

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:09.420
and really thinking about
the subjective reality

01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:12.810
and focusing on adaptive mindsets.

01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:15.170
So my goal as a parent

01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:18.380
has been to try to help her
instill a healthy mindset

01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:19.630
about eating,

01:30:19.630 --> 01:30:22.610
that healthy foods are
indulgent and delicious.

01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:25.580
That the experience of
stress is inevitable,

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.960
that it's natural.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:30.900
And that going through
stressful experience

01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:32.540
can help her learn, grow,

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:36.090
and become a more connected
and happier individual.

01:30:36.090 --> 01:30:39.380
And with exercise and physical activity,

01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:40.740
we haven't really gotten to that yet,

01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.120
but [laughs] we will with time.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.240
- Yeah, that's great.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.073
I wrote down

01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:46.970
and I'm going to keep this
in the front of my mind,

01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:49.960
going forward, to continually ask

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.610
what is the effect of my mindset about X?

01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:54.100
And just to evaluate that.

01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:56.420
About exercise, about food,
about school, about stress,

01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:57.570
about relationships,

01:30:57.570 --> 01:31:00.120
about relationship to self, et cetera.

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:03.040
And to really think about
that in a series of layers

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:05.140
that you think that would
be a useful exercise?

01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:07.613
- Definitely, and you know,
and your work speaks to this.

01:31:07.613 --> 01:31:10.890
I mean, the mindful, it's not--

01:31:10.890 --> 01:31:15.390
I would really urge against
people getting dogmatic

01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:16.810
about their mindset also, right?

01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:18.430
Like, oh, I need to
have the right mindset.

01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:19.780
Or, and if I don't have the right mind--

01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:23.030
It's like, okay, mindset
is a piece of the puzzle.

01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:26.430
It's a piece of the puzzle
that's really empowering

01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:29.390
because we have access to
it and we can change it.

01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:31.230
But it is just one piece of a puzzle.

01:31:31.230 --> 01:31:34.090
So treat yourself like a
scientist, look at your life,

01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:37.010
look at your mindsets,
see what's serving you,

01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:38.450
see what isn't.

01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:42.290
Find more useful, adaptive,
and empowering mindsets

01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:45.750
and live by those.

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:46.750
- I love it.

01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:50.800
Now, in one version of
this kind of discussion,

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:52.210
I would have asked

01:31:52.210 --> 01:31:54.250
the question I'm going to
ask next at the beginning,

01:31:54.250 --> 01:31:58.040
but I'm going to ask it
now close to the end,

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:02.330
which is, you're unique
constellation of accomplishments

01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:06.120
and attributes, and I only know
a subset of them, of course,

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.320
because today's the first
time that we've met in person,

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.810
even though I've known
your work for a long time

01:32:09.810 --> 01:32:11.770
and we're colleagues across campus.

01:32:11.770 --> 01:32:15.890
So you run your laboratory,
where you do research.

01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:20.480
You were also an athlete in
university, a serious athlete,

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:23.972
and then you're also a clinical
psychologist, is that right?

01:32:23.972 --> 01:32:25.670
- I was trained as a
clinical psychologist.

01:32:25.670 --> 01:32:28.290
So my PhD is in clinical psychology.

01:32:28.290 --> 01:32:33.090
And I did all my pre and post internships

01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:35.550
that dealt with stress and trauma.

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:37.372
- Do you see patients or did
you see patients at that time?

01:32:37.372 --> 01:32:38.205
- I did.

01:32:38.205 --> 01:32:39.038
Yes, I don't anymore.

01:32:39.038 --> 01:32:41.560
- Okay, that's a very unique constellation

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.623
of practitioner and researcher.

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:49.040
So what are the mindsets
that you try and adopt

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.970
on a regular basis in as a consequence

01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:53.203
or in relation to those things,

01:32:53.203 --> 01:32:56.400
sort of athlete, researcher, clinician?

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.450
For yourself as you move through life,

01:32:58.450 --> 01:33:01.530
do you have an overarching mindset

01:33:01.530 --> 01:33:04.280
that all challenge's good,

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.830
or do you have any kind
of central mindsets

01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:09.290
that help you navigate through,

01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:10.230
you know, it was passed

01:33:10.230 --> 01:33:12.940
to be a pretty complex
set of daily routines

01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:14.540
given everything that you juggle.

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:17.470
But I think that people
like you are unique,

01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:20.410
in that you have the inside knowledge

01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:22.090
of how this stuff works,

01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:24.210
and you've also existed in
these different domains.

01:33:24.210 --> 01:33:25.330
And I know a lot of listeners

01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:29.540
have a more athletic slant to their life

01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:31.710
or a more cognitive or
some are raising kids,

01:33:31.710 --> 01:33:35.030
or some people are doing
any number of things.

01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:36.480
So, this is where I
think it would be useful

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.580
for people to hear kind
of, what do you do?

01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:40.010
This is what I'm asking.

01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:42.410
- Yeah, well, it's
certainly true in my case,

01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:44.193
that research is me search.

01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:48.990
Everything that I study as an intellectual

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:53.597
has come from my own experience
or my own failings, right?

01:33:53.597 --> 01:33:58.597
And when I was really intensely
exercising and training,

01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:01.810
those were the questions I asked

01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:06.280
when I was dealing with eating
and concerns about my weight,

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.700
those were the questions I asked.

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:10.950
When I was stressed about my dissertation.

01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:13.930
I decided to do my
dissertation on stress, right?

01:34:13.930 --> 01:34:16.973
Now I think we're in the
midst of a global pandemic.

01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:21.963
How can our mindsets be useful here?

01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:27.640
I don't think there's a
obvious answer to your question

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.720
other than the guiding light for me

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:35.150
has been an undercurrent of understanding

01:34:35.150 --> 01:34:36.150
that our mindsets matter.

01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:40.080
I think I got that very
clearly and deeply as a child,

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.983
both through my experiences as an athlete.

01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:45.950
I know many of you listeners are athletes.

01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:49.550
Any athlete knows that you
can be the same physical being

01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:52.060
from one day to the next
one moment to the next,

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:54.970
and perform completely differently,

01:34:54.970 --> 01:34:57.010
just depending on what you're thinking.

01:34:57.010 --> 01:34:58.960
I was a gymnast growing up.

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:01.000
And if you can't visualize,

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.580
if you can't see something in your mind

01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:03.780
then you have no chance

01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:05.850
when you get up there on
the balance beam, right?

01:35:05.850 --> 01:35:08.550
And also, my father was a martial artist,

01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:09.740
a teacher of meditation.

01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:12.050
So this kind of mind body work

01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:15.170
was baked into me from an early age.

01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:17.040
And I think what I've done recently,

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.960
is to try to understand it scientifically,

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:22.030
and more importantly,

01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:26.683
to figure out how can we
do better with this, right?

01:35:27.536 --> 01:35:30.500
We're all talking about
AI taking over the world,

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:33.340
and technology this and all
the personalized medicine that,

01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:37.140
and it's like, we have
done so little, relatively,

01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:42.140
so little with the human
resource, our human brains,

01:35:43.330 --> 01:35:48.330
that the potential for which is so great.

01:35:49.090 --> 01:35:51.380
And we've done almost nothing.

01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:55.460
Take the placebo effect, we
know a lot about what it is.

01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:59.050
We've done almost nothing
to leverage that in medicine

01:35:59.050 --> 01:36:00.820
consciously and deliberately.

01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:05.820
So, what keeps me going, what
gets me through the hard times

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:09.457
is just that burning question
of, what is going on here

01:36:09.457 --> 01:36:13.070
and what more can I do
with the power of my mind?

01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:16.830
- Well, I and millions of
other people are so grateful

01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:17.752
that you do this work.

01:36:17.752 --> 01:36:20.160
It's so important and it's truly unique.

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.940
Tell us where people can learn
more about your research,

01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.510
where they can find you online.

01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:25.610
I'm going to try and persuade you

01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:29.390
to take more of a social
media presence going forward.

01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:32.170
But whether or not I succeed
in that effort or not,

01:36:32.170 --> 01:36:35.830
where can people find you, ask
questions, find your papers,

01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:37.350
learn more.

01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:39.477
I'd love to have you back for
a conversation in the future,

01:36:39.477 --> 01:36:41.050
but in the meantime.

01:36:41.050 --> 01:36:44.360
- Yeah, it's been such an
honor getting to chat with you

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.177
and just you have such
an impact on the world.

01:36:47.177 --> 01:36:48.010
And I look forward.

01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:49.850
I hope we can do some
science together also.

01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:51.030
- Absolutely, absolutely.

01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:55.540
- Yeah, all our papers and
materials and interventions

01:36:55.540 --> 01:37:00.467
are housed on our
website, mbl.stanford.edu.

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.030
We also have a link there too,

01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:04.830
that takes you to Stanford SPARK,

01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:07.530
which stands for social
psychological answers

01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:09.000
to real world questions.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.640
We have a lot of toolkits on that website,

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:16.160
including a toolkit for
this rethink stress approach

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.470
of acknowledging, welcoming,
and utilizing your stress.

01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:24.860
And then I guess I'm on
Twitter, Alia Crum, [chuckles],

01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:28.080
I don't do much there,
but maybe I will start to.

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.280
- Well, those are all great resources.

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.070
We will provide links to all of those

01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:32.910
for our listeners and viewers.

01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:36.060
And I also hope to convince you

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:38.760
to write a book or many
books in the future.

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.100
The world needs to know about this,

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:42.810
but thank you so much for taking time

01:37:42.810 --> 01:37:44.700
out of your exceedingly busy schedule

01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:46.620
to talk to us about these ideas.

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:47.460
I learned so much.

01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:49.590
I'm going to definitely think about

01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:52.320
what is the effect of
my mindset about blank

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.330
in every category of life

01:37:54.330 --> 01:37:57.960
and really, on behalf
of everybody and myself.

01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.290
Thank you so much.

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:00.229
- Yeah, thank you.

01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:01.980
And I guess I just want to end by saying,

01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.010
I think this work is really
the tip of the iceberg

01:38:05.010 --> 01:38:07.100
of what can and should be done.

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:10.776
And so, I really invite
you, your listeners,

01:38:10.776 --> 01:38:13.810
and anybody who's inspired by this work.

01:38:13.810 --> 01:38:15.580
If they want to share stories

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:20.390
or want to partner on a
collaboration to please reach out.

01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:22.230
- Great, well, and the
comments section on YouTube

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:24.730
is a great place to do that as well.

01:38:24.730 --> 01:38:25.670
You will hear from them.

01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:27.400
- Great, [laughs].
- All right.

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.330
Thank you so much, Allie.

01:38:28.330 --> 01:38:29.163
- Thank you.

01:38:30.130 --> 01:38:31.860
- Thank you for joining
me for my conversation

01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:33.890
with Dr. Alia Crum.

01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:36.200
I'm guessing by now, you can appreciate

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.410
the enormous impact that mindsets have

01:38:38.410 --> 01:38:40.770
on our biology and our psychology,

01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:44.540
and how those interact at
the level of mind and body.

01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:46.770
If you'd like to learn
more about Dr. Crum's work,

01:38:46.770 --> 01:38:49.000
and perhaps even be a research subject

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.560
in one of their upcoming
studies on mindsets,

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:55.120
you can go to mbl.stanford.edu.

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:58.000
There, you will also
see a tab for support,

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.120
where if you like, you can
make a tax deductible donation

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.860
to support the incredible research

01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:05.050
that Dr. Crum and her
colleagues are doing.

01:39:05.050 --> 01:39:06.760
If you're learning from and are enjoying

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.110
the Huberman Lab Podcast,

01:39:08.110 --> 01:39:09.900
please subscribe to our YouTube channel.

01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:12.180

to leave us up to a five star review.

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.810
On YouTube, you also have the opportunity

01:39:21.810 --> 01:39:24.880
to leave us questions and
comments in the comment section

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.410
below any of the episodes.

You can also make suggestions
about future guests

01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:31.600
that you'd like us to host
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.120
Please also check out our sponsors

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.200
mentioned at the
beginning of this episode,

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.400
that's the best way to
support this podcast.

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:41.080
We also have a Patreon, it's
patreon.com/andrewhuberman,

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:42.870
and there you can support the podcast

01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:44.600
at any level that you like.

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.930
If you're not already
following us on Instagram

01:39:46.930 --> 01:39:49.010
and on Twitter, we are Huberman Lab

01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:50.490
at both Instagram and Twitter,

01:39:50.490 --> 01:39:53.500
and there I teach
neuroscience in short form,

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.810
sometimes videos, sometimes texts, slides.

01:39:55.810 --> 01:39:56.770
Some of that information

01:39:56.770 --> 01:39:58.690
overlaps with what you
find on the podcast.

01:39:58.690 --> 01:40:01.420
Some of it is distinct from
what you find on the podcast.

01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.910
On previous episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast,

01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:05.430
I often discuss supplements.

01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:08.410
While supplements aren't
necessary or used by everybody,

01:40:08.410 --> 01:40:11.220
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them.

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:13.170
An important consideration
when using supplements

01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:16.480
is that they be sourced from
the highest quality sources.

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.570
For that reason, we partner
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

01:40:19.570 --> 01:40:20.480
Because Thorne supplements

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.010
use the highest quality ingredients

01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:23.710
and the greatest degree of precision,

01:40:23.710 --> 01:40:25.190
in terms of what's listed on the bottle

01:40:25.190 --> 01:40:27.850
is actually what you will
find in their products.

01:40:27.850 --> 01:40:29.670
And that is not true for
all supplement companies.

01:40:29.670 --> 01:40:31.220
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:36.220
you can go to Thorn, that
T-H-O-R-N-E.com/U/Huberman,

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.670
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements.

01:40:39.670 --> 01:40:41.890
In addition, if you navigate
into the Thorne site

01:40:41.890 --> 01:40:45.140
through that portal,
thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:47.810
you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements

01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:49.050
that Thorne makes.

01:40:49.050 --> 01:40:50.670
In closing, I'd like
to thank you once again

01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:53.000
for joining me for my
discussion about mindsets

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.730
with Dr. Alia Crum,

01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:57.338
and as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

01:40:57.338 --> 01:40:59.921
