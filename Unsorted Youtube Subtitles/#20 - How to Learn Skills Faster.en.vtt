00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.410
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.427
where we discuss science

00:00:03.427 --> 00:00:07.059
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:09.430
[instrumental music]

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.470
- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.880
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.680
This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.480
and research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.570
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.570
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.710
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.920
In keeping with that theme,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.100
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.753
Our first sponsor is
Belcampo Meat Company.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.020
Belcampo Meat Company
is a regenerative farm

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.180
in Northern California that
raises organic grass fed

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.540
and grass-finished certified humane meats.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.390
I eat meat about once a day.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.790
I'm neither pure carnivore,
nor am I a vegetarian.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.090
Obviously I eat meat.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.050
The way I eat is I tend
to fast until about noon

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.420
and then I have my first meal

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.060
which generally consists
of a piece of beef.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.610
It's either ground beef or a steak.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.440
I like ribeyes, I like flat
irons, these kinds of things

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.980
and a small salad,
sometimes a large salad.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.780
And then throughout the
day, I generally am low carb

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.190
until the evening when
I eat pasta and rice

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.050
and things of that sort.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.870
Eating that way is what
optimizes my levels of alertness

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.710
and optimizes my sleep.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.660
I've talked about this on
previous podcast episodes,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.280
Now, because I eat meat
essentially every day,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.530
the source of that meat is
extremely important to me.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.930
I want it to be healthy for me

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.500
and I want the animals that it comes from

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.020
to be healthy and to
have lived a good life.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.530
Conventionally raised animals
are confined to feedlots

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.870
and they eat a diet of
inflammatory grains,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.100
which is terrible for them
and it's terrible for us

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.640
when we eat those meats.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.960
Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.090
and seasonal grasses,
which results in meat

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.200
that is higher in
nutrients and healthy fats.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.980
They actually have very
high levels of Omega threes

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.810
which I've also talked
about on this podcast,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.820
are important for mental
and physical health

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.710
for a variety of reasons.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.390
The way Belcampo raises its animals

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.950
is also good for the environment.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.790
They practice regenerative agriculture,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.960
which means it's climate
positive and carbon negative

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.860
which translates to good for
us and good for the planet.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.110
You can order Belcampo
sustainably raised meats

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.380
to be delivered straight to your door

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.010
using my code Huberman by
going to belcampo.com/huberman

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.240
and you'll get 20% off
your first time order.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.100
That's belcampo.com/huberman for 20% off.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.780
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.290
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.890
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.620
to help you better understand your body

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.720
and reach your health goals.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.650
I've long been a believer
in getting blood work done

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.600
for the simple reason that many,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.930
if not most of the factors that impact

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.750
our immediate and longterm health

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.130
can only be assessed from a blood test.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.930
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.480
we can get additional information

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.770
about our current health status
and our health trajectory.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.600
One of major problems with
blood tests and DNA tests

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.940
available for most sources is
that you get the numbers back

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.940
and you can easily see
whether or not those numbers

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.550
are within the standard
range or outside the range.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.330
But it's very hard to know what
to do with that information.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.730
Also what the various factors are

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.240
that are being measured
is often very cryptic.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.160
With InsideTracker,
they clarify everything.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.200
They make it very clear and simple

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.130
as to what each of those
factors relates to,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.560
so they give you some
understanding of what those are

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.700
and they give you ideas and suggestions

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.330
about things that you can
do with your lifestyle,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.360
changes to your diet, changes
to your supplementation,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.800
changes to your sleep
schedule or exercise patterns

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.310
that can serve to optimize the levels

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.510
of those various factors and your DNA.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.440
In addition, they have something
called the inner age test

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.070
which compares your chronological age

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.600
which you already know
with your biological age

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.700
which gives you a sense of your lifespan

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.150
or predicted lifespan.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.650
So that's crucially
important, and you can imagine

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.830
why many people, including me
would want that information.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.440
If you'd like to try InsideTracker

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.640

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.560
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.400
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.100
probiotic drink.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.410
I've been using Athletic Greens
for well over a decade now.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.760
I started using Athletic
Greens and I still use

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.480
Athletic Greens because
I find it rather dizzying

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.960
to know which vitamins
and minerals to take.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.020
And with Athletic Greens,
I cover all my bases

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.370
of vitamins and minerals.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.550
In addition, it has
probiotics and we now know

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.450
from an enormous number of
quality peer reviewed studies

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.800
that the gut microbiome
is critically important

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.240
for our immune system function,
for the gut brain access

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.970
and for our mental functions

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.620
and probiotics are one way
to support the gut brain axis

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.840
and the gut health generally.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.750
With Athletic Greens, I
basically just add water,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.110
put in a little bit of lemon juice

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.440
'cause that's the way I like it.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.760
Mix it up, it tastes delicious.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.540
I'll do that once or twice a day.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.660
It's compatible with
fasting at least for me,

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.410
it doesn't take me out of a fasting mode

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.800
which I do early in the day.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.760
So most often I'll have my
Athletic Greens early in the day.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.150
And then sometimes I'll
also have another one

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.630
late in the evening, or
sometimes even before bed.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.790
I'm able to sleep after
drinking it without a problem.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.710
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.620
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.310
And if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.230
They'll give you five free travel packs,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.710
which are these little
packs that make it very easy

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.750
to mix up Athletic Greens
while you're on the road

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.185
or in the car or on a plane.

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:46.150
It makes all of that very simple.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.310
And in addition, they will
give you a year supply

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.180
of vitamin D3 K2.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.493
There are also a lot of
data supporting the fact

00:05:52.493 --> 00:05:54.840
that vitamin D3 is critical

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.440
for a variety of health metrics.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.700
We all know that we can get vitamin D3

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.350
from the sun, but many people including me

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.590
were not getting enough sunlight or D3

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.070
even if I was getting a lot of sunlight.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.170
I know that 'cause I had my
blood levels measured of D3.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.180
So I use vitamin D3 every day

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.020
in addition to the other things I take,

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.200
including Athletic Greens.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.150
If you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.630
you'll get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.340
and a year supply of
the vitamin D3 and K2,

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.550
That's athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.740
to claim the special offer.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.670
This month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.560
we're talking all about
physical performance.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.400
So that means athletic
performance, recreational exercise,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.170
weightlifting, running, swimming, yoga,

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.370
skills and skill learning.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.590
Today, we're going to talk about and focus

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.230
on skill learning.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.730
We are going to focus on how
to learn skills more quickly

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.630
in particular motor skills.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.770
This will also translate to things

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.560
like musical skills and
playing instruments,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.130
but we're mainly going to
focus on physical movements

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.370
of the body that extend beyond the hands

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.360
like just playing the piano or the fingers

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.840
like playing the guitar.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.550
But everything we're going to talk about

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.280
will also serve the formation
and the consolidation

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.780
and the performance of
other types of skills.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.220
So if you're interested
in how to perform better,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.180
whether or not it's dance or yoga

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.150
or even something that's
just very repetitive

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.900
like running or swimming, this
podcast episode is for you.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.510
We're going to go deep into
the science of skill learning.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.140
And we are going to talk
about very specific protocols

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.290
that the science points
to and has verified,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.120
allow you to learn more
quickly to embed that learning

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.290
so that you remember it and
to be able to build up skills

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.250
more quickly than you would otherwise.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.140
We are also going to touch on a few things

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.710
that I get asked about a
lot, but fortunately recently

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.850
I've had the time to go
deep into the literature,

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.770
extract the data for you and
that's mental visualization.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.790
How does visualizing a
particular skill or practice

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.820
serve the learning and
or the consolidation

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.980
of that practice.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.410
It turns out there are some
absolutely striking protocols

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.000
that one can use, striking
meaning they allow you

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.180
to learn faster and they
allow you to remember

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.360
how to do things more quickly and better

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.370
than if you were not doing
this mental rehearsal.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.610
But the pattern of mental rehearsal

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.680
and when you do that mental rehearsal

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.940
turns out to be vitally important.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.200
So I'm excited for today's episode.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.940
We're going to share a lot
of information with you

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.260
and they're going to be a
lot of very simple takeaways.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.110
So let's get started.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.570
Before we get into the
topic of skill learning

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.060
and tools for accelerating skill learning,

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.640
I want to briefly revisit
the topic of temperature

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.263
which was covered in the last episode

00:08:48.263 --> 00:08:49.670
and just highlight a
few things and clear up

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.210
some misunderstandings.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.290
So last episode talked
about these incredible data

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.350
from my colleague, Craig
Heller's lab at Stanford.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.000
He's in the department of biology,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.070
showing that cooling the
palms in particular ways

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.130
and at particular times can allow athletes

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.200
or just recreational
exercisers to do more pull-ups,

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.700
dips, bench presses per
unit time, to run further,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.960
to cycle further and to
feel better doing it.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.360
There really are incredible
data that are anchored

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.360
in the biology of the vascular
system, the blood supply

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.050
and how it's involved in cooling us.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.257
Many of you, dozens of you in fact said,

00:09:29.257 --> 00:09:33.557
"Wait a second, you gave us
a protocol in this episode

00:09:33.557 --> 00:09:36.837
"which says that we should
cool our palms periodically

00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:39.883
"throughout exercise in order
to be able to do more work.

00:09:41.056 --> 00:09:44.277
"But on the episode, before
that on growth hormone

00:09:44.277 --> 00:09:48.347
"and thyroid hormone, you
said that heating up the body

00:09:48.347 --> 00:09:51.130
"is good for release of growth hormone."

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.840
And I just want to clarify
that both things are true.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.470
These are two separate protocols.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.650
You should always warm
up before you exercise.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.120
That warmup will not increase
your body temperature

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.870
or the muscle temperature to the point

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.560
where it's going to
diminish your work capacity,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.460
that it's going to harm your performance.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.330
The cooling of the palms,
which is really just a route

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.540
to cool your core in an efficient way,

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.630
the most efficient way, in fact

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.600
is about improving performance.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.870
Heating up the body with exercise

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.680
and focusing on heat
increases or using sauna

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.170
for heat increases is geared
toward growth hormone release,

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.740
which is a separate matter.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.780
So you can do both of these protocols

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.440
but you would want to do
them at separate times.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.310
So just to make this very concrete

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.090
before I move on to today's topic.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.880
If you're interested in doing more work,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.370
being able to do more sets
and reps per unit time

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.950
and feel better doing it or to run further

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:53.230
or to cycle further, then
cooling the palms periodically

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.370
as I described in the previous episode

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.800
is going to be the way to go.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.460
If you're interested in
getting growth hormone release,

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.280
well then hot sauna.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.930
And I offered some other tools
if you don't have a sauna

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.740
in the episode on growth
hormone and thyroid hormone

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.490
is going to be the way to go.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.010
So those are separate protocols.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.610
You can include them
in your fitness regime

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.960
and your training regime,
but you do want to do them

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.640
at separate times.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.890
And as a last point about this,

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.030
I also mentioned that
caffeine can either help

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.110
or hinder performance
depending on whether or not

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.450
you're caffeine adapted
because of the ways

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.890
that caffeine impacts body temperature

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.600
and all sorts of things like
vasodilation and constriction.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.000
It's very simple.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.810
If you enjoy caffeine before your workouts

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.360
and you're accustomed to
caffeine, meaning you drink it

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.810
three or five times or more a week.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.050
100 to 300 milligrams this
is a typical daily dose

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.657
of caffeine.

00:11:44.657 --> 00:11:45.620
Some of you are ingesting more, some less.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.080
If you do that regularly,

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.860
well, then it's going to be
just fine to ingest caffeine

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.693
before you train.

00:11:50.693 --> 00:11:53.026
It's not going to impact
your body temperature

00:11:53.026 --> 00:11:54.910
and your vasodilation or constriction

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.930
in ways that will hinder you.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.570
However, if you're not
a regular caffeine user

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.847
and you're thinking, "Oh, I'm
going to drink a cup of coffee

00:12:00.847 --> 00:12:03.440
"and get this huge
performance enhancing effect."

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.240
Well, that's not going to happen.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.840
Chances are it's going
to lead to increases

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.460
in body temperature and changes
in the way that blood flow

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.290
is happening in your
body, and in particular

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.710
on these palmer surfaces and in your face

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.920
that is going to likely
diminish performance.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.030
So if you enjoy caffeine
and you're accustomed to it,

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.840
so-called caffeine adapted,
enjoy it before your training.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.530
If you regularly, excuse
me, if you do not regularly

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.700
use caffeine, then you probably
do not want to view caffeine

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.340
as a performance enhancing tool.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.970
And while we're on the topic of tools

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.760
and because this is a month
on athletic performance

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.093
and exercise and physical skill learning,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.770
I want to offer an additional tool

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.060
that I've certainly found
useful, which is how to relieve

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.590
the so-called side stitch or side cramp

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.373
when running or swimming.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.520
This actually relates to respiration

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.073
and to the nervous system
and it is not a cramp.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.530
If you've ever been out
running and you felt like

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.530
you had a pain on your side,

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.930
that pain could be any number of things,

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.450
but what feels like cramping of your side

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.493
is actually due to what's
called collateralization

00:13:15.493 --> 00:13:17.930
of the phrenic nerve which
is a lot harder to say

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.020
than a side cramp or a side stitch.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.120
But here's the situation.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.200
You have a set of nerves, which
is called the phrenic nerve

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.000
P-H-R-E-N-I-C.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.940
The phrenic nerve, which
extends down from your brainstem

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.020
essentially, this region to your diaphragm

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.700
to control your breathing.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.330
It has a collateral,
meaning it has a branch

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:45.033
just like the branch on a tree
that innovates your liver.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.960
And if you are not
breathing deeply enough,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.230
what can happen is you can
get what's called sometimes

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.020
a referenced pain.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.940
Reference pain is probably
going to be familiar

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.590
to any of you have ever read

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.460
about how to recognize heart attack.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.620
People have heart attacks
will sometimes have pain

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.870
on one side of their body, the left arm,

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.280
sometimes people that have
pain in a part of their back

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.230
or suddenly also get
pain in their shoulder

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.063
or part of their face.

00:14:10.063 --> 00:14:13.530
This has to do with the fact
that many of our nerves branch,

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:14.960
meaning they're collateralized

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.730
to different organs and areas of the body.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.983
And the way those nerves
are woven together,

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.630
it's often the case that
if we disrupt the pattern

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.150
of firing of electrical activity

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.480
in one of those nerve branches

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.540
that the other ones are affected too.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.970
The side stitch, the pain
in your side as often

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.150
because of the contractions
of the diaphragm

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.730
because of the way you're
breathing while you're exercising,

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.370
running, or swimming or biking.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.480
And as a consequence, you
feel pain in your side

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.490
but that's not a cramp.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.810
The way to relieve it is very simple.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.510
You do the physiological
side that I've talked about

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:54.080
in previous episodes of
the podcast and elsewhere

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.070
which has a double
inhale through the nose,

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.050
very deep and then a long exhale.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.470
And you might want to repeat
that two or three times.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.930
Typically that will
relieve the side stitch

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.750
because of the way that it
changes the firing patterns

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.430
of the phrenic nerve.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.120
So the side stitch is
annoying, it's painful,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.800
sometimes we think we're dehydrated

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.990
and you might be dehydrated.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.310
But oftentimes it's just
that we're breathing

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.480
in a way that causes some
referenced pain of the liver.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.240
We call it a side stitch or a side cramp,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.730
and you can relieve it very easily

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.013
through the double inhale, long exhale.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.750
That pattern done two or three times,

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.610
often you can continue
to engage in the exercise

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.750
while you do the double inhale exhale,

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.020
and it will just relieve itself that way.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.820
So give it a try if you
experience the side stitch.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.670
Some people I know are also
doing the double inhale,

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.890
long exhale during long
continuous bouts of exercise.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.730
I actually do this when I run.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.910
We have decent data
although these are still

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.070
unpublished data that that can engage

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.860
a kind of regular cadence
of heart rate variability.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.260
So there are a number of reasons
why this physiological side

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.570
can be useful, but it
certainly can be useful

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.710
for relieving the side stitch
or so-called side cramp.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.490
Let's talk about the
acquisition of new skills.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:16.490
These could be skills such as
a golf swing or a tennis swing

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.520
or you're shooting free throws
or you're learning to dance

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.760
or you're learning an instrument.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.540
I'm mainly going to focus
on athletic performance.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.933
There are basically two types of skills.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.793
Open loop and closed loop.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.290
Open loop skills are
skills where you perform

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.610
some sort of motor
action and then you wait

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.550
and you get immediate feedback

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.980
as to whether or not it
was done correctly or not.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.020
A good example will be
throwing darts at a dartboard.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.760
So if you throw the dart, you get feedback

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.290
about whether or not you hit the bullseye,

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.420
you're off the dart board,
or you're some other location

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.680
on the dart board, that's open loop.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.160
Closed loop would be something
that's more continuous.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.710
So let's say you're a
runner and you're starting

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.300
to do some speed work and some sprints.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.490
And you're running and
you can kind of feel

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.670
whether or not you're running correctly,

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.140
or maybe even have a coach
and they're correcting

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.963
your stride or you're trying
to do some sort of skill,

00:17:17.968 --> 00:17:21.240
like a hopscotch skill,
which maybe you're doing

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.700
the ladder work where you're stepping

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.030
between designated spaces on the ground.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.380
That's closed loop because as you go,

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.640
you can adjust your behavior
and you can adjust the distance

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.430
of your steps, or you
can adjust your speed

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.640
or you can adjust your
posture and you are able

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.290
to essentially do more
practice per unit time

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:47.112
but you're getting feedback
on a moment to moment basis.

00:17:47.112 --> 00:17:48.160
So you have open loop and closed loop.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.440
And just to make this very clear,

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.910
open loop would be
practicing your tennis serve.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.010
So let's say that you set a target

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.520
on the other side of the net.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.960
You throw the ball up
and you hit the ball,

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.793
it goes over that's open-loop.

00:18:02.793 --> 00:18:03.770
You'll know whether or
not you were in the court,

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.640
you were on the location you wanted to hit

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.260
or close to it or not, that's open loop.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.582
Closed loop would be if
you're in a regular can.

00:18:12.582 --> 00:18:14.959
So maybe you're learning a swim stroke,

00:18:14.959 --> 00:18:16.700
or maybe you're trying to
learn a particular rhythm

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.173
on the drum.

00:18:18.173 --> 00:18:19.080
So maybe you're trying to
learn a particular beat.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.350
I'm not very musical, so I'm
not going to embarrass myself

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.793
by giving an example of
this, although later I will,

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.580
where you're trying to get
a particular rhythm down.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.040
And if you're not getting it,
you can adjust in real time

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.000
and try and catch up or slow
down or speed up, et cetera.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.560
So hopefully you'll understand
open loop and closed loop.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.990
You should always know before
you try and learn a skill,

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.780
whether or not it's
open loop or closed loop

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.470
and I'll return to why
that's important shortly.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.990
But if you want to learn something,

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.033
ask is it open loop or closed loop.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.540
There are essentially three
components of any skill

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.510
that involves motor movement.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.660
And those are sensory
perception, actually perceiving

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.180
what you are doing and
what's happening around you.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.440
So what you see, what you hear,

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.480
sometimes you're paying
attention to what you're doing

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.960
specifically like the
trajectory of your arm

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.330
or how you're moving your feet.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.700
If you're learning to dance,
sometimes you're more focused

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.600
on something that's
happening outside of you,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.840
like you're listening
for something in music

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.750
or you're paying attention

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.220
to the way your partner
is moving, et cetera.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.280
So there's sensory input.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.500
Then there are the actual movements.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.360
So they're the movements
of your limbs and body.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.950
And then there's something
called proprioception

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.420
and proprioception is often discussed

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.110
as kind of a sixth sense of
knowing where your limbs are

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.140
in relation to your body.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.150
So proprioception is vitally important.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.210
If I reached down and pick
up this pen and pick it up,

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.020
I'm not thinking about
where the pen in my hand is

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:55.020
relative to my body, but
proprioceptively, I'm aware of it

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.150
at kind of a six sense
deeper subconscious level.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:02.280
I can also make myself
aware of where my limbs are.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.130
And typically when we learn,
we are placing more focus

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.000
on proprioception than we do ordinarily.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.500
So if I get up from this
chair and I happen to walk

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.870
out of the room, I don't
think about where my feet

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.860
are landing relative to one another.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.430
But if my leg had fallen asleep

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.090
because I had been leaning on
one of the nerves of my leg

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.680
or something like that, and my
leg feels all tingly or numb.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.350
I and you, if this were to happen to you,

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.980
would immediately notice a shift in gait.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.600
It would feel strange,
I'd have to pay attention

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.460
to how I'm stepping.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.416
And the reason is I'm not getting

00:20:36.416 --> 00:20:38.180
any proprioceptive feedback.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.880
Now, skill learning has a
lot of other dimensions too,

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.420
but those are the main ones
that we're going to focus on.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.760
So just to remind you,
you need to know open loop

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.230
or closed loop and you need
to know whether or not,

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.520
excuse me, you need to know
that there's sensory perception

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.333
what you're paying attention to,

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.510
movements themselves and proprioception.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:02.420
And there's one other important
thing that you need to know

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.660
which is that movement
of any kind is generated

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.730
from one, two or three sources
within your nervous system,

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.910
within your brain and body.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.520
These are central pattern generators

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.363
which are sometimes called
CSPGs, excuse me, CPGSs,

00:21:20.722 --> 00:21:23.222
CSPGs are something entirely
different in biology.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.990
CPGSs, this just goes to
show that I have a module.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.230
CSPGs are chondroid and
sulfate proteoglycans.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.880
They have nothing to do with this topic.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.840
CPGSs are central pattern
generators or CPGs,

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.370
they're sometimes called.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:43.370
These CPGs are in your
spinal cord, mine and yours,

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.000
different ones and they
generate repetitive movements.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.070
So if you're walking, if you're
running, if you're cycling,

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.340
if you're breathing,
which presumably you are

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.700
and you're doing that in a
regular rhythmic cadence,

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.810
central pattern generators
are controlling that movement.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.540
After you learn how to
walk, run, swim, cycle,

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.230
do anything really, much
of the work is handed off

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.650
to the central pattern generators.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.540
And there were experiments that were done

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.700
in the 60s, 70s and 80s
that actually looked

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:20.700
at decerebrate animals and
even decerebrate humans.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.650
These are humans and animals
that lack a cerebral cortex.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.310
They lack much of the brain
and yet they can engage

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.660
in what's called a fictive movement.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.730
So it sounds like a kind
of barbaric experiment.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.117
I'm glad I wasn't the
one to have to do them

00:22:35.117 --> 00:22:36.620
but this is the stuff of
neuroscience textbooks

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.620
that cats or dogs or mice that
have their neocortex removed

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.570
put them on a treadmill,
they'll walk just fine.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.820
And they will adjust their
speed of walking just fine

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.250
even though they basically
lack all their thinking

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.597
and decision-making brain.

00:22:51.597 --> 00:22:53.960
And it turns out humans that have,

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.750
unfortunately, massive
strokes to their cortex

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.170
and lack any neocortex but preserve

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:04.570
the central pattern generators
will also walk just fine,

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.890
even though they lack any of
the other stuff in the brain.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:12.290
So these CPGs or CPGSs are amazing,

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:16.000
and they control a lot of
our already learned behavior.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.930
When you're really good at something,

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.273
CPGs are controlling a
lot of that behavior.

00:23:22.798 --> 00:23:24.760
And that's true also for a golf swing.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.700
Even if it's not really repetitive,

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.830
somebody who's really good
at golf it's going to,

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.550
I guess you call it a T.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.570
You put the ball on the T.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.750
I show with my knowledge of golf.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.450
I've only done mini golf, frankly,

00:23:36.618 --> 00:23:37.750
but someday maybe I'll learn how to golf,

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.490
but you set the golf ball down and swing,

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.920
set the golf ball down, swing.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.780
Central pattern generators
are going to handle

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:44.870
a lot of that.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.580
If I were to go to the golf course.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.000
Stanford has a beautiful golf course.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.880
If I were to go out there
and put a ball on the T,

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.900
my central pattern generators
would not be involved

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.280
in that at all.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:58.460
The moment I bring the club back to swing,

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.860
it's going to engage other things.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.670
And the other things
that's going to engage

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.170
because I don't know
that behavior now or then

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.530
is upper motor neurons.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.560
We have motor neurons in our cortex,

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.270
in our neocortex that
control deliberate action.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.520
And those are the ones
that you're engaging

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.200
when you are learning.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.410
Those are the ones that
you have to pay attention

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.120
in order to engage.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.350
And that's what's happening, for instance,

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.194
if I decide I'm going to
reach down and pick up my pen,

00:24:29.194 --> 00:24:31.181
which I rarely think about,
but now I'm thinking about it

00:24:31.181 --> 00:24:32.014
and I'm going to do this
in a very deliberate way.

00:24:32.014 --> 00:24:33.720
I'm going to grab with
these two fingers and lift.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.907
My upper motor neurons are now involved.

00:24:36.907 --> 00:24:39.340
So upper motor neurons are very important

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.490
because a little bit later in the episode

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.400
when we talk about how
to use visualization

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.050
in order to accelerate skill learning,

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.510
it's going to leverage
these upper motor neurons

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.100
in very particular ways.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.770
So we have CPGs for rhythmic movement,

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.850
upper motor neurons for
deliberate unlearned movements

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:59.730
or movements that we are
in the process of learning.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.490
And then we have what are
called lower motor neurons.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.000
Lower motor neurons are
the ones in our spinal cord

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.840
that send little wires out to our muscles

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.873
which actually caused the
firing of those muscle fibers.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.910
So the way to think
about this as you've got

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.430
upper motor neurons which talk to CPGs

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:16.640
and the lower motor neurons.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.080
So it's really simple.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.340
And now, you know most
everything there is to know

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.330
about the neural pathways
controlling movement,

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.263
at least for sake of this discussion.

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:29.940
So anytime we learn
something, we have to decide

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.940
what to place our sensory perception on,

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.360
meaning what are we going to focus on.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.030
That's critical if
you're listening to this

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.450
and you're the type of person
who likes taking notes,

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.680
this should be the
second question you ask.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.810
Remember the first question
is, is it open loop

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.040
or closed loop?

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.823
The second question should be,

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.150
what should I focus my attention
on, auditory attention,

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.250
visual attention or proprioception.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.380
Should I focus on where my
limbs are relative to my body

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.820
or should I focus on the outcome?

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.640
This is a critical distinction.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.010
You can decide to learn
how to do a golf swing

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.690
or learn how to shoot free throws

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.901
or learn how to dance tango

00:26:07.901 --> 00:26:09.160
and decide that you are going to focus

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.810
on the movements of your partner

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:14.380
or the positions of your feet.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.150
You maybe are going to look at them,

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:17.940
maybe you're going to sense them.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.980
You're going to actually
feel where they are,

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.230
or maybe you're going
to sense the position

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.170
and posture of your body,
which is more proprioception.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.220
So you have to allocate your attention.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.490
And I'm going to tell you how
to allocate your attention

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.500
best in order to learn faster.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.760
So these are the sorts of
decisions that you have to make.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.640
Fortunately for you,
you don't have to think

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.730
about whether or not you're going to use

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.090
your upper motor neurons
and your lower motor neurons

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.734
or not, because if you don't
know how to do something,

00:26:44.734 --> 00:26:45.567
you're automatically going to engage

00:26:45.567 --> 00:26:46.410
your upper motor neurons.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.440
And if you do, then
you're not going to use

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.310
your upper motor neurons.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.840
You're mainly going to rely
on central pattern generators.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.980
You are always using
your lower motor neurons

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.130
to move muscle.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.790
So we can really simplify things now.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.270
I've given you a lot of
information but we can simplify it.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.400
Basically open loop or closed
loop, that's one question

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.160
and what am I going to focus on?

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.840
And then your neurology
will take care of the rest.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.693
So now I want to talk about
realistic expectations.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:18.490
Somewhere in Hollywood presumably,

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.910
it got embedded in somebody's mind

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.440
that instant skill
acquisition was possible,

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.490
that you could take a particular pill

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.140
or you could touch a particular object

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.850
or you could have a wand wave over you

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.660
and you would suddenly have a skill.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.703
And so that is the result
of Hollywood at all.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.690
It doesn't exist, at least not in reality.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:47.040
And I love movies, but
it simply doesn't exist.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.660
Then the self-help literature
created another rule

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.310
called the 10,000 hours rule.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.930
And frankly, that doesn't
really match the literature,

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.030
at least the scientific literature either.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.890
I like it because it implies
that learning takes time,

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.630
which is more accurate
than the Hollywood at all

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.000
instant skill acquisition rule,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.710
which isn't really a rule, it's a myth.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:18.520
But the 10,000 hours rule
overlook something crucial,

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.620
which is that it's not about hours,

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.410
it's about repetitions.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.860
Now, of course there's a
relationship between time

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.860
and repetitions, but there
are some beautiful experiments

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:36.860
that point to the fact
that by simple adjustment

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.800
of what you are focused
on as you attempt to learn

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.590
a new skill, you can adjust
the number of repetitions

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.840
that you do, you adjust
your motivation for learning

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.363
and you can vastly accelerate learning.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.270
Some of you may recognize
this by its internet name,

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.950
which is not a scientific term,

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.220
which is the super Mario effect.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.060
There's actually a quite
good video on YouTube

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.750
describing the super Mario effect.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.960
I think it was a YouTuber
who has I think a background

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.070
in science and he did an
interesting experiment.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.770
And I'll talk about his experiment first

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.750
and then I will talk
about the neurobiology

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:20.220
that supports the result that he got.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.100
The super Mario effect relates to the game

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.170
super Mario brothers, but
you'll see why at the end.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:30.810
But basically what they did
was they had 50,000 subjects,

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:35.810
which is a enormous number
of subjects learn a program,

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.240
essentially taking words
from a computer program

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.740
or the commands for a computer program

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.010
that were kind of clustered
in a column on the right.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.640
So these are the sorts of
things that computer programmers

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.890
will be familiar with
but other people won't.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.120
And those commands are essentially,

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.430
they essentially translate
to things like go forward.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.540
And then if it's a right
hand turn in the maze,

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.420
then go right and continue
until you hit a choice point,

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.725
et cetera.

00:30:03.725 --> 00:30:05.940
So it's a bunch of instructions,
but the job of the subjects

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.380
in these experiments were to
organize those instructions

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.270
in a particular way that
would allow a little cursor

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.740
to move through the main successfully.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.440
So basically the goal was,
or at least what the subjects

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.120
were told is that anyone can
learn to computer program.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.860
And if somebody can just
organize the instructions

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.210
in the right way, then they can program

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.483
this little cursor to move
through amaze, very simple.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.790
And yet, if you don't have any background

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.800
in computer programming,
or even if you do,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.090
it takes some skill.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.740
You have to know what commands to give

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.750
in what particular order.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:39.810
And they made that very easy.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.700
You could just assemble them in a list

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.793
over onto the right.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.720
So people started doing this.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.720
Now there were two groups and
some one half of the subjects,

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:56.150
if they got it wrong, meaning
they entered a command

00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:00.960
and the cursor would move
and it was the wrong command

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.030
for this little cursor
to move through the maze,

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:07.903
they saw a signal jump up
on their screen that said,

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.783
that did not work, please try again.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.680
That's it, if they put
in the wrong command

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.560
or is in the wrong sequence,
it'll say that did not work

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.994
please try again.

00:31:17.994 --> 00:31:20.410
And then the subjects would
reorganize the instructions

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:21.820
and then the little cursor would continue.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.600
And if they got it wrong again,

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.240
it would say that does not
work, please try again.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.200
The other half of the subjects,
if they got something wrong

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:35.200
were told you just lost five
points, please continue.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.430
So, that's the only
difference in the feedback

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.930
that they got.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.770
Now I have to confess,
I would have predicted

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.020
based on my knowledge
of dopamine circuitry

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:52.020
and reward contingency
and epinephrin and stress

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.410
and motivated learning.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.750
And this other thing that we've been told

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.860
in many many books on behavioral economics

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.140
and in the self-help literature,

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.780
which is that people will work much harder

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.240
to prevent losing something than they will

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.390
to gain something, that
you hear all the time.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:13.110
And it turns out that that's
not at all what happened.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:17.730
If they looked at the
success rate of the subjects,

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.930
what they found was that
the subjects that were told

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:25.930
that did not work, please try
again, had a 68% success rate.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.330
68% of them went on to
successfully program this cursor

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.000
moving through the maze.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.540
Whereas the ones that were
told you lost five points

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:40.500
had a 52% success rate, which
is a significant difference.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:45.140
But the source of the success
or the lack of success

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.070
is really interesting.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.760
The subjects that were
told that did not work,

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.760
please try again, tried many,
many more times per unit time.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.570
In other words, they made
more attempts at programming

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.350
this thing to allow this cursor
to move through the maze.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.000
Whereas the people that were
told you lost five points

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.190
gave up earlier or gave up entirely.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.430
Okay, so let's just step back from this

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.170
because to me, this was very surprising.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.240
It violates a lot of things that I'd heard

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.080
in the kind of popular culture
or the self-help literature

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.900
that people will work much
harder to avoid losing something

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.590
than they will to gain something.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.430
And it didn't really fit
with what I understood

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.493
about reward contingencies and dopamine,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.550
but it did fit well with
another set of experiments

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:32.810
that I'm very familiar with

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.670
from the neuroscience literature.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.360
And I'll give you the punchline first.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.450
And then we're going to
take what these data mean

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.390
and we're going to talk
about a learning protocol

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:45.110
that you can use that will
allow you to learn skills faster

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:49.490
by willingly participating
in more repetitions

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.560
of the skill learning,
meaning you will want

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:55.370
to do more repetitions even
if you're getting it wrong

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.790
some or most of the time.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:00.350
So the experiment that
I want to tell you about

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.850
is called the tube test.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.980
And this is generally done in mice,

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.560
although it's sometimes been done in rats

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.510
and it has a lot of
parallels to some things

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:12.230
that you've probably
seen and experienced even

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.240
in human life, in regular
life, maybe even in your life.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.010
So here's the experiment.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.820
You take two rats, you put
them in a tube or two mice,

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.160
you put them in a tube.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.820
And mice and rats, they don't
like to share the same tube.

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.550
So what they'll do is they'll
start pushing each other

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.570
back and forth, back and forth.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.730
Sooner or later, one of the rats or mice

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.830
pushes the other one out.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:36.380
The one that got pushed out is the loser,

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.430
the one that gets the tube is the winner.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:44.140
Now you take the winner, you
give it a new competitor.

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.050
And what you find is that the mouse or rat

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.560
that won previously has a much higher

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.750
than chance probability of
winning the second time.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:35:00.610
In other words, winning
before leads to winning again.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:01.930
And the reverse is also true.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.860
If you take the loser
and you put that loser in

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.003
with another mouse,
fresh mouse, new mouse,

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.430
the loser typically will lose
at much greater probability

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:13.263
than chance.

00:35:13.263 --> 00:35:16.570
And this is not related to
differences in strength or size

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:18.670
or testosterone or any other things

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:21.130
that might leap to mind
as explanations for this

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.510
because those were all controlled for.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.650
Now that results have been
known about for decades.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.550
But three years ago, there
was a paper published

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.530
in the Journal Science,
phenomenal journal.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.090
It's one of the three apex journals,

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:37.550
that examined the brain area
that's involved in this.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.450
Turns out a particular
area of the frontal cortex

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:41.780
for those of you that want to know.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.120
And they did a simple experiment
where the experimenters

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.560
increased or decreased the
activity of this brain area

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.580
in the prefrontal cortex,

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.130
little sub region of
the prefrontal cortex.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:54.373
And what they found is if they
stimulated this brain area,

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.110
a mouse or rat, regardless
of whether or not

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.130
it had been a winner or loser before,

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:02.393
became a winner every single time.

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.760
And they showed that if
they blocked the activity

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.750
of this brain area,
regardless of whether or not

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.780
the mouse or rat had
been a winner or loser,

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.721
it became a loser every single time.

00:36:14.721 --> 00:36:16.660
And this translated to other scenarios,

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.500
other competitive scenarios
where they'd put a bunch of mice

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.490
or rats in a kind of cool chamber,

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.100
they'd have a little
heat lamp in the corner

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.223
and mice like heat.

00:36:27.067 --> 00:36:28.380
And there was only enough
space for one mouse

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.340
to be under the heat.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.370
And the one that had won in the tube test

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.960
or that had the brain area stimulated

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.163
always got the nice warm spot.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.440
So what is this magic brain
area, what is it doing?

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.400
Well, the reason I'm
bringing this up today

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.400
and the reason I'm
bringing it up on the heels

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.350
of the super Mario effect
is that stimulation

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:51.310
of this brain area had a very simple

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:52.950
and very important effect,

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:57.370
which was, it led to more
forward steps, more repetitions,

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:01.530
more effort, but not in terms
of sheer might and will,

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:05.653
not digging deeper, just more
repetitions per unit time.

00:37:06.518 --> 00:37:09.810
And the losers had fewer
repetitions per unit time.

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.410
So the super Mario effect,
this online experiment

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.240
and the tube test, which has been done

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.860
by various labs and
repeated again and again

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.230
point to a simple but very important rule,

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.590
which is neither the 10,000 hours rule

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.900
nor the magic wand Hollywood
version of learning.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.510
But rather the
neuro-biological explanation

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:33.310
for learning a skill
is you want to perform

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:37.563
as many repetitions per unit
time, as you possibly can.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.810
At least when you're first
trying to learn a skill.

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:45.120
I want to repeat that, you want
to perform as many repetitions

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.380
as you possibly can at least
when you're first trying

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.453
to learn a skill.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.680
Now that might sound like
a duh, it just more reps,

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.090
but it's not so obvious.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.400
There's no reason why more repetitions

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.830
should necessarily lead to faster learning

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.940
because you could also say,
well, more repetitions,

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.150
you can make more errors

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.630
and those errors would
lead to poor performance

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.920
like misstepping a number of times.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.630
And in these cases, there's
very little feedback.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:17.780
It's not like every time
the rat pushes forward

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.010
or moves back that it is sensing,

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.830
oh I'm winning, I'm losing,
I'm winning, I'm losing

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:23.478
on a micro level.

00:38:23.478 --> 00:38:24.900
It probably does that as it
starts to push the other one out

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.730
the rat or mouse probably
thinks, "I'm winning."

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.540
And as it's backing up, it
probably thinks, "I'm losing."

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.923
As you play the game,
the super Mario game,

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.080
you are told, nope, that didn't work.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.130
Nope, that didn't work, please try again.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:42.540
But the important thing
is that the winners

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.490
are always generating more
repetitions per unit time.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:49.780
It's just a repeat of
performance, repeat of performance

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.170
even if there are errors.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:54.080
And that points to
something vitally important,

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:59.080
which is reps are important
but making error reps

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:01.310
is also important.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.782
In fact, it might be the
most important factor.

00:39:04.782 --> 00:39:08.060
So let's talk about errors and
why those solve the problem

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.940
of what to focus on.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.780
Because as I said earlier, if
you want to learn something,

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.330
you need to know if it's
open loop or closed loop

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.400
and you need to know what to focus on,

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.050
where to place your perception.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:21.130
And that seems like a tough task

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.580
but errors will tell you
exactly what to focus on.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.650
So let's talk about errors and
why you can leverage errors

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:29.630
to accelerate skill learning.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:31.640
Okay, so we've established that performing

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.660
the maximum number of
repetitions per training session

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.680
is going to be advantageous.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.060
And that might seem obvious
but there's a shadowy side

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.650
to that, which is, well why
would I want to just repeat

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.505
the same thing over and over
again if I'm getting it wrong,

00:39:48.505 --> 00:39:50.085
90% of the time.

00:39:50.085 --> 00:39:52.090
And the reason is that
the errors actually cue

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.180
your nervous system to two things;

00:39:55.180 --> 00:40:00.180
one to error correction and
the other is it opens the door

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.940
or the window for neuroplasticity.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.280
Neuroplasticity is the brain
and nervous system's ability

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.630
to change in response to experience,

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.480
essentially to custom modify itself

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.940
in order to perform anything better.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.490
We did an entire month on neuroplasticity

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:17.680
and I talked a little bit about errors

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.100
and why they're important.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.400
Now we're going to make this very concrete

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.640
and operationalize it,
make it very actionable.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.920
There was a paper that
was published in 2021

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.620
from Norman at all.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.050
This is a very important paper.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.550
It was published in the Journal Neuron

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.560
which is a cell press
journal, excellent journal.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.420
The title of the paper
gives it away essentially,

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.540
which is post error
recruitment of frontal sensory

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.540
cortical projections promotes attention.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:50.540
Now, what that says is that
when you make an error,

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:54.660
it causes an activation of the brain areas

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.740
that anchor your attention.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.970
Remember we need perception, attention,

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.270
which they're essentially the same thing.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.410
We need proprioception
and we need the upper

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:06.770
and lower motor neurons to
communicate in the proper ways.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:09.840
And this vital question is
what to pay attention to.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.090
Errors tell your nervous system

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.990
that something needs to change.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:17.020
So if you are performing a task or a skill

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.544
like you're learning how to
dance and you're stepping

00:41:19.544 --> 00:41:20.750
on the other person's
toes or you're fumbling

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.290
or you're not getting it right,

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:25.380
those errors are opening the
possibility for plasticity.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.301
If you walk away at that point,

00:41:27.301 --> 00:41:30.820
you've made the exact wrong choice.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.340
Unless the errors are somehow
hazardous to your health

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.800
or somebody else's wellbeing,
you want to continue

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.280
to engage at a high repetition rate.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.730
That's really where the
learning is possible.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.750
Without errors, the brain
is not in a position

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.220
to change itself.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:51.230
Errors actually cue the
frontal cortex networks,

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:54.480
what we call top-down processing
and the neuromodulators,

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.190
things like dopamine and
acetylcholine and epinephrin

00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:00.010
that will allow for plasticity.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.820
So while the super Mario experiment,

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.160
the maze experiment was only
focused on generating errors,

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.060
telling people that wasn't
right, please try again

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.820
or that wasn't right,
you lost five points.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.780
The key distinction is
that the errors themselves

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.440
cued people to the fact that they needed

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.180
to change something.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:20.090
So if you're trying to learn a new skill

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.480
and you're screwing up and
you're making mistakes,

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.940
the more mistakes you
make, the more plastic

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.840
your brain becomes such
that when you get it right,

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:33.520
that correct pattern will be
rewarded and consolidated.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.390
And you can trust that it will

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.860
because the performance
of something correctly

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.710
is associated with the release

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.610
of this neuromodulator dopamine.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:44.630
Dopamine is involved in
craving and motivation.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:45.820
It's involved in a lot of things,

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.013
but it's also involved in learning.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:52.010
We will do an entire episode
on dopamine and learning

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.880
but because some of you
are probably wondering,

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.550
this does not mean that just
increasing your dopamine levels

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.830
before learning will
allow you to learn faster.

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:03.660
In fact, increasing your
dopamine levels before learning

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:06.410
using pharmacology will actually reduce

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:07.930
what's called the signal to noise.

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:10.400
It will make these increases in dopamine

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.127
that pop up in your brain that
suddenly make you realize,

00:43:13.127 --> 00:43:14.750
"Oh, I got that one right."

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.220
It will make those smaller relative

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:20.440
to the background levels of dopamine.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.500
You want a big spike in
dopamine when you perform

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.110
a motor pattern correctly and
you want to make lots of errors,

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.630
many, many repetitions of errors

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:32.200
in order to get to that
correct performance.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.830
Now, if you're like most
people you're going to do this

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:37.780
in a way that's somewhat random.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.450
Meaning let's say it's a tennis serve.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.630
I can't play tennis,

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:42.880
I think I've probably played tennis twice.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.550
So if I throw the ball
up in the air and hit it,

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:46.590
I'm going to get it wrong
and probably hit the net,

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.423
then it hit the net.

00:43:47.423 --> 00:43:48.760
Then I'll probably go too long

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.160
then I'll probably go over the fence.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.903
At some point, I like to
think I'll get it correct.

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:56.550
The dopamine signal for that
is going to be quite big

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.497
and I'll think, "Okay,
what did I do there?

00:43:59.497 --> 00:44:01.267
"I actually don't know, I
wasn't paying attention.

00:44:01.267 --> 00:44:03.610
"What I was paying attention
to is whether or not

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:05.413
"the ball went to the correct location

00:44:05.413 --> 00:44:06.246
"on the opposite side of the net."

00:44:06.246 --> 00:44:07.610
Remember it's an open loop move,

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:09.850
so I don't actually know
what I did correctly.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.240
But your nervous system
will take care of that

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:16.100
provided I in this case
complete more and more

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.160
and more repetitions.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.060
Now, if I were to just elevate
my basil level of dopamine

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.739
by taking, I don't know,
1500 milligrams L tyrasine

00:44:23.739 --> 00:44:25.930
or something, that would
be bad because the increase

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:28.633
in dopamine would actually be much lower.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.370
We would say the delta is smaller.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:33.280
The signal to noise is smaller

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.830
if my overall levels of
dopamine are very, very high.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:37.840
So I'm actually going to learn less well.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.470
So for skill learning,
motor skill learning,

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:44.130
increasing your dopamine levels
prior is not a good idea.

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.610
It might help with motivation
to get to the learning

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:49.590
but it's not going to improve
the plasticity process itself

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.050
and it's likely to hinder it.

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:53.650
And so that's very important.

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:58.650
So these errors cue the brain
that something was wrong

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.970
and they open up the
possibility for plasticity.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.850
It's what sometimes
called the framing effect,

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:06.435
it frames what's important.

00:45:06.435 --> 00:45:09.010
And so I think this is a
shift that we've heard about,

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:13.500
growth mindset which is the
incredible discovery and theory

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.840
and practice of my colleague,
Carol Dweck at Stanford.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.800
This is distinct from that.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.090
This isn't about motivation to learn,

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:21.590
this is about how you actually learn.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:24.780
So the key is designate a
particular block of time

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.730
that you are going to perform repetitions.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:30.190
So maybe that's 30 minutes,
maybe that's an hour.

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.720
Work for time and then try and perform

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.180
the maximum number of repetitions
that you can do safely

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.060
for you and others per unit time.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.429
That's going to be the best
way to approach learning

00:45:42.429 --> 00:45:44.060
for most sessions.

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.470
I will talk about other
things that one can do,

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.240
but making errors is key.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.740
And this isn't a motivational speech.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.167
I'm not saying, "Oh, go make errors,

00:45:52.167 --> 00:45:53.051
"errors are good for you.

00:45:53.051 --> 00:45:53.884
"You have to fail in order to win."

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:57.540
No, you have to fail in order
to open up the possibility

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.390
of plasticity, but you
have to fail many times

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.210
within the same session.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:05.090
And those failures will cue your attention

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:06.920
to the appropriate sensory events.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.120
Now, sometimes we're working with a coach.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.740
And so this is a shout
out to all the coaches,

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:13.810
thank you for doing what you do.

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:17.640
However, there needs to be at least

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.660
what the scientific literature say.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.970
There needs to be a period
of each training session

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:25.440
whereby the athlete or
the person of any kind

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.800
can simply pay attention to their errors

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.050
without their attention
being cued to something else.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:32.497
A really well-trained coach will say,

00:46:32.497 --> 00:46:34.547
"Oh, your elbows swinging too high,

00:46:34.547 --> 00:46:36.407
"or you're not gripping the racket

00:46:36.407 --> 00:46:38.360
"in the appropriate way," et cetera.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.910
They can see things that
the practitioner can't see.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:43.040
And of course that's
the vitally important.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.920
But the practitioner also needs to use

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.970
this error recognition signal,

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.777
they need to basically focus on something

00:46:52.777 --> 00:46:56.200
and the errors are going to
tell them what to focus on.

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.450
So put simply there needs
to be a period of time

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.420
in which it's just
repetition after repetition,

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.253
after repetition.

00:47:02.253 --> 00:47:04.490
I think many people including coaches

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:07.450
are afraid that bad
habits will get ingrained.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:10.110
And while indeed that's possible,

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:12.510
it's very important
that these errors occur

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:14.750
in order to cue the attentional systems

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.960
and to open the door for plasticity.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.787
So if I'm told, "Look, I'm
standing a little wide,

00:47:19.787 --> 00:47:22.230
"I need to tighten up
my stance a little bit."

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.720
Great, but then I need to
generate many repetitions

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.360
from that tighten stance.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.500
So if I'm constantly being
cued from the outside

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.300
about what I'm incorrectly,

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.480
that's not going to be as efficient.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.960
So for some people,
these learning sessions

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.400
might be 10 minutes, for some
people, it might be an hour.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.210
Whatever you can allocate
because your lifestyles

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.810
will vary in your whether or not

00:47:42.858 --> 00:47:43.950
you're a professional
athlete, et cetera will vary.

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:46.300
You want to get the maximum
number of repetitions in

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:47.590
and you want to make errors.

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:49.830
That's allowing for plasticity.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.490
So science points to the fact

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:55.540
that there's a particular
sequencing of learning sessions

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.400
that will allow you to learn faster

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.780
and to retain the skill learning

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:03.030
and involves doing exactly
as I just described,

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:06.110
which is getting as many
repetitions as you can

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:10.340
in the learning session,
paying attention to the errors

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.173
that you make.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.670
And then the rewards
that will be generated,

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:16.620
again, these are neurochemical rewards

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.930
from the successful
performance of a movement

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:22.390
or the approximate successful performance.

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:25.970
So maybe you get the golf
swing better but not perfect,

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.340
but that's still going to be rewarded

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.660
with this neurochemical mechanism.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.730
And then after the session,

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:35.930
you need to do something very specific

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:37.493
which is nothing.

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:39.703
That's right.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:45.130
There are beautiful
data describing neurons

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:48.950
in our hippocampus, this
area of our brain involved

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:50.983
in the consolidation of new memories.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.963
Those data points to
the fact that in sleep,

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:59.220
there's a replay of
the sequence of neurons

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:02.000
that were involved in certain
behaviors the previous day

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.403
and sometimes the
previous day before that.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.550
However, there are also data that show

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:11.100
that after a skill learning session,

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:16.100
any kind of motor movement
provided you're not bringing in

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.223
a lot more additional new sensory stimuli,

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.460
there's a replay of the motor sequence

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:29.460
that you performed correctly
and there's an elimination

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:33.420
of the motor sequences that
you performed incorrectly

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:37.740
and they are run backward in time.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.550
So to be very clear about
this, if I were to learn

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:42.900
a new skill or navigate a new city

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.980
or let's just stay with the motor skill,

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:49.170
let's say the free-throw or a
golf swing or a tennis serve,

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:51.480
dance move, novice.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.990
So I'm still going to
make a lot of errors,

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.080
don't get it perfectly,

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.210
but maybe I get a little bit better

00:49:56.210 --> 00:50:00.435
or I perform it correctly
three times out of 1000.

00:50:00.435 --> 00:50:02.130
And it sounds like something I might do

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:04.930
and there I'm probably
being generous to myself.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:06.883
After I finished the training session,

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.710
if I do nothing, I'm not focused

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:11.940
on some additional learning.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.610
I'm not bringing a lot of
sensory information in.

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:17.550
If I just sit there and close my eyes

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:21.510
for five to 10 minutes, even one minute,

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:24.250
the brain starts to
replay the motor sequence

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:28.160
corresponding to the
correct pattern movement,

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.910
but it plays that sequence backward.

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:34.330
Now why it plays it
backward, we don't know.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:37.320
If I were to wait until
sleep or regardless

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.373
of when I sleep later that night,

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:44.050
the sequence will be replayed forwards

00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:46.423
in the proper sequence.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.470
Immediately afterward
it's played a backward

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:51.660
for reasons that are still unclear.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.670
But the replay of that sequence backwards

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:57.720
appears to be important
for the consolidation

00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.083
of the skill learning.

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:02.470
Now, this is important because many people

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:05.090
are finishing their jujitsu class

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:06.640
or they're finishing their yoga class

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.130
or they're finishing their dance class

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:10.080
or they're finishing some skill learning

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.280
and then they're immediately
devoting their attention

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.293
to something else.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:16.120
You hear a lot about visualization

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.670
and we are going to talk
about visualization.

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.260
But in the kind of obsession with the idea

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.980
that we can learn things,
just sitting there

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.800
with our eyes closed without
having to perform a movement,

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.510
we've overlooked something
perhaps even more important

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:30.840
or at least equally important,

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.280
which is after skill
learning, after putting effort

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.630
into something, sitting
quietly with the eyes closed

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:42.730
for one to five to 10
minutes allows the brain

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:46.490
to replay the sequence in a
way that appears important

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:50.890
for the more rapid consolidation
of the motor sequence

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.620
of the pattern and to
accelerated learning.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.870
If you'd like to learn more about this,

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:57.580
this is not work that I was involved in,

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.000
I want to be very clear.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.040
There's an excellent paper
that covers this and much more

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.522
for those of you that really
want to dive deep on this

00:52:04.522 --> 00:52:05.830
and we will dive deeper in a moment.

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.870
This is a review that was
published in the Journal Neuron,

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:10.063
excellent journal.

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:12.900
Many of the papers that I'm referring to

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.850
were covered in this
review which is titled,

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:19.650
Neuroplasticity Subserving
Motor Skill Learning by Dayan

00:52:21.405 --> 00:52:24.080
D-A-Y-A-N, I hope I'm not
butchering the pronunciation

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.930
and Cohen, by Leonard Cohen,

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:30.000
but not the Leonard Cohen
most of us are familiar with,

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.490
the musician, Leonard Cohen.

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:34.940
Dayan and Cohen, neuroplasticity

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.170
subserving motor skill learning.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:42.170
And this was published in
2011, but there've been

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:45.690
a number of updates and the
literature that I've described

00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:48.820
in other portions of today's episode

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.590
come from the more recent literature

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:53.090
such as the more recent 2021 paper.

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.780
So you have this basic learning session

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.190
and then a period of time afterwards

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.540
in which the brain can
rehearse what it just did.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.390
We hear so much about mental rehearsal

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:02.960
and we always think about mental rehearsal

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.760
as the thing you do before you
train or instead of training.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.990
But this is rehearsal
that's done afterward

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:10.910
where the brain is just automatically

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:12.290
scripting through the sequence.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:15.270
And for some reason,
that's still not clear

00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:18.830
as to why this would be
the case it runs backward.

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:23.810
Then in sleep, it runs forwards
and certainly absolutely,

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.600
sleep and quality sleep of
the appropriate duration,

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.824
et cetera is going to be important

00:53:28.824 --> 00:53:29.930
for learning of all kinds,
including skill learning.

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:33.010
We did an entire four episodes on sleep

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:34.060
and how to get better at sleeping.

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:36.530
Those are the episodes
back in January episodes,

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:38.380
essentially one, two, three, and four

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:42.350
and maybe even episode
five, I don't recall.

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:44.390
But you can go there to find out

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:46.880
all about how to get better at sleeping.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.170
Now there are other
training sessions involved.

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:51.810
I'm not going to learn
the perfect golf swing

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:54.790
or the tennis serve or how
to dance in one session

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.350
and I doubt you will either.

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:00.580
So the question is when to come back

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:03.160
and what to do when you come
back to the training set.

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:07.370
Now, first of all, this
principle of errors

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:10.850
queuing attention and
opening the opportunity

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:14.440
for plasticity, that's
never going to change.

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.270
That's going to be true for
somebody who is hyper skilled

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:22.270
who's even has mastery or even
virtuosity in a given skill.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.360
Remember, when you're
unskilled at something,

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.610
uncertainty is very high.

00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:30.680
As you become more
skilled, certainty goes up.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.810
Then eventually you
achieve levels of mastery

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:35.500
where certainty is very
very high about your ability

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:39.675
to perform, yours certainty
en that of other people.

00:54:39.675 --> 00:54:42.800
And then there's this fourth
category of virtuosity

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:46.100
where somebody, maybe
you invites uncertainty

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:49.260
back into the practice because
only with that uncertainty,

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:52.740
can you express your
full range of abilities

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.060
which you aren't even aware of

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.263
until uncertainty comes into the picture.

00:54:57.774 --> 00:55:01.140
I happened to have the great privilege

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:04.520
of being friends with Laird
Hamilton, the big wave surfer

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.430
who's phenomenal.

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.280
I don't surf, I certainly
don't surf with Laird,

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.213
but he, and another guy that
he starts with Luca Patua,

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:16.280
these guys, they're virtuosos at surfing.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.320
They don't just want the
wave that they can master,

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.560
they want uncertainty.

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.210
They're at the point in their practice

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:25.480
where when uncertainty
shows up like a wave

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:30.480
that's either so big or is
moving in a particular way

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.990
that it brings an element
of uncertainty for them

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:36.700
about what they're going to
do that they recognize that

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.340
as the opportunity to perform better

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:40.363
than they would otherwise.

00:55:40.363 --> 00:55:42.410
So they're actually trying
to eliminate uncertainty.

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:44.884
At the beginning of learning any skill

00:55:44.884 --> 00:55:47.460
and as we approach from
uncertain to skilled to mastery,

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.440
we want to reduce uncertainty.

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.020
And that's really what the
nervous system is doing,

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.070
it's trying to eliminate
errors and hone in

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:55.033
on the correct trajectories.

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:59.720
If you perform a lot of repetitions

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.770
and then you use a
period immediately after,

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:04.000
we don't really have a name for this,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.200
maybe someone will come up with it

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.430
and put it in the comment section

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:09.520
if you're on YouTube, if you're
watching this on YouTube,

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.440
a name for this post
learning kind of idle time

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:13.273
for the brain.

00:56:13.273 --> 00:56:15.290
The brain is an idol at
all, it's actually scripting

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:18.350
all these things in reverse
that allow for deeper learning

00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:21.500
and more quick learning.

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.583
But if we fill that with other things,

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.910
if we are focused on our
phones or we're focused

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:27.930
on learning something else,

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:30.620
we're focusing on our performance,

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.270
that's not going to serve us well,

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:34.110
it's at least it's not going to
serve the skill learning well.

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:36.490
So please, if you're interested
in more rapid skill learning

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:39.700
try introducing these sessions,
they can be quite powerful.

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.330
And then on subsequent sessions,

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:43.230
presumably after a night's sleep

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:44.710
or maybe you're doing two sessions a day,

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:46.560
although two sessions a
day is going to be a lot

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.350
for most people, unless
you're a professional

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:53.350
or a high-level athlete,
the subsequent sessions

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:57.470
are where you get to express the gains

00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:01.970
of the previous session,
where you get to perform well,

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:04.110
presumably more often
even if it's just subtle.

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:06.100
Sometimes there'll be a
decrease in performance,

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.820
but most often you're
going to perform better

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:12.360
on subsequent and subsequent
training sessions.

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:16.380
And there is the opportunity
to devote attention

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:21.380
in very specific ways, not
just let the errors inform you

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:26.410
where to place your attention,
but rather to direct

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:30.160
your perception to particular
elements of the movement

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.030
in order to accelerate learning further.

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:36.010
So to be very clear,
'cause I know many of you

00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:38.810
are interested in concrete protocols.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:41.250
It's not just that you
would only let errors

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:43.290
cue your attention on the first session.

00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:46.000
You might do that for one
session or five sessions,

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.070
is going to depend.

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.577
But once you're familiar with something

00:57:48.577 --> 00:57:51.080
and you're performing it
well every once in a while,

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.750
you're accomplishing it
better every once in a while,

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:56.470
then you can start to cue your attention

00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:58.460
in very deliberate ways.

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.170
And the question therefore becomes

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:02.530
what to cue your attention to.

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:05.623
And the good news is it doesn't matter.

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:10.520
There is a beautiful set of
experiments that have been done

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:15.490
looking at sequences of keys
being played on a piano.

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:18.150
This is work that was published
just a couple of years ago.

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:20.050
There are actually several papers now

00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:22.090
that are focused on this.

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.370
One of them was published in 2018.

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:29.370
This is from Claudia Lappe
and colleagues, L-A-P-P-E.

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:31.940
She's done some really nice
work, which talks about

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.950
the influence of pitch feedback

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:36.130
on learning of motor
timing and sequencing.

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:37.680
And this was done with piano

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.180
but it carries over to
athletic performance as well.

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:42.340
So I'm going to describe the study to you,

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:46.560
but before I describe it,
what is so interesting

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.260
about this study that I
want you to know about

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:53.780
is that it turns out it
doesn't matter so much

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:57.070
what you pay attention to
during the learning sequence

00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:59.920
provided it's something
related to the motor behavior

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.760
that you're performing.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.310
That seems incredible.

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:06.440
I'm not good at a tennis serve.

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:09.000
So if I've done let's say
a thousand repetitions

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:09.890
of the tennis serve.

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:12.110
Maybe I got it right three to 10 times.

00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:13.750
Now I'm being even more
generous with myself.

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:16.110
And I do this post-training session

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:18.630
where I let my brain idle
and I get some good sleep

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:22.020
and I come back and now I
start generating errors again,

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:24.780
presumably or hopefully fewer errors,

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:26.570
but I decide I'm going to cue my attention

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:29.780
to something very specific,
like maybe how tightly

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:32.300
I'm holding the racket
or maybe it's my stance,

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:36.170
or maybe it's whether or not
I rotate my right shoulder in

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:37.813
as I hit the ball across.

00:59:38.787 --> 00:59:40.260
And I'm making this up,
again I don't play tennis.

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:43.380
Turns out that it as long
as it's the same thing

00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:46.300
throughout the session,
learning is accelerated.

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:50.660
And I'll explain why this
make sense in a moment.

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:55.150
But just to be really clear,
you can and one should

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:58.670
use your powers of attention
to direct your attention

00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:00.400
to particular aspects of a motor movement

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.480
once you're familiar with the
general theme of the movement.

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.580
But what you pay attention
to exactly is not important.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.100
What's important is that you pay attention

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.070
to one specific thing.

01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:13.070
So what Claudia Lappe
and colleagues showed

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:17.110
was that if people are trying
to learn a sequence of keys

01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:21.510
on the piano, there are
multiple forms of feedback.

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:24.150
There are error signals if for instance,

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:25.940
they hear a piece of music
and then they're told

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.459
to press the keys in a particular sequence

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:32.060
and the noise that comes
out, the sound that comes out

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.790
of the piano does not sound
like the song they just heard.

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:37.830
So instead of, and here, forgive me

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:40.980
because I'm neither
musical, nor can I sing.

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:45.550
But instead of dah, dah
dah, dah, they hear that,

01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:47.220
dah, dah dah, dah

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.820
and then instead when they play.

01:00:49.821 --> 01:00:51.329
If it were me, it sounds something like,

01:00:51.329 --> 01:00:54.150
dah, dah dah [indistinct],
it wouldn't sound right.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.320
It wouldn't sound right, because
I likely got the sequence

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.210
wrong, or I was pressing
too hard on the keys

01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:00.653
or too lightly on the keys, et cetera.

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:06.670
What they showed was if
they just instruct people

01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:10.060
about the correct sequence
to press on the keys,

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.520
it actually doesn't matter
what sound comes back,

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.520
provided it's the correct
sound or it's the same sound.

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:19.320
All right, so here's the experiment.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.060
They had people press on these keys

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.700
and it was a typical
piano and it generated

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.050
the particular sequence of
sounds that would be generated

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:27.750
by pressing the keys on the piano.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:33.090
Or they modified the keyboard
in this case or piano

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.860
such that when people pressed on the keys,

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.920
a random tone different tones were played

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.520
each time they pressed on the keys.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.060
So it sounded crazy,
it sounded like noise,

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.190
but the motor sequence was the same.

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:51.040
Or they had a single tone
that was played every time

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.420
they pressed a key and the
job or the task of the subject

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.310
was just oppressed the keys
in the proper sequence.

01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:00.868
So instead of dunt,
dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,

01:02:00.868 --> 01:02:03.410
it it was just dunt,
dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt.

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:05.040
Instead of dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.770
it's dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:10.120
It's even hard for me to
say it in even a tone,

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.010
but you get the idea.

01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:13.960
So a singular tone, just
think a doorbell being rung

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.510
with each press of the key
will be really annoying.

01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:21.790
But it turns out that the
rate to motor learning

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:27.100
was the same, whether or not
they were getting feedback

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:29.280
that was accurate to the keys of the piano

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.040
or whether or not it was a constant tone.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.674
Performance was terrible
and the rates of learning

01:02:35.674 --> 01:02:38.180
were terrible if they were
getting random tones back.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.710
So what this means is that
learning to play the piano

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:42.520
at least at these early stages

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.270
is really just about
generating the motor commands.

01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:49.390
It's not about paying
attention to the sound

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:52.095
that's coming out of the piano.

01:02:52.095 --> 01:02:54.340
And this makes sense because
when we are beginners,

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.110
we are trying to focus our
attention on the things

01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:58.730
that we can control.

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:03.710
And if you think about this,
if you conceptualize this,

01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:06.460
pressing the keys on the
piano and paying attention

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.940
to the sounds that are
coming out are two things.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:12.260
So what this means is
that as you get deeper

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.460
and deeper into a practice,

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:19.020
focusing purely on the motor
execution can be beneficial.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.000
Now, this is going to be harder to do

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.770
with open loop type things
where you're getting feedback.

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:26.350
I guess a good example of open loop

01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:28.260
would be the attempt at a back flip.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.360
If you get it wrong, you
will immediately know,

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.210
if you get it right,
you'll immediately know.

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:33.860
Please don't go out and
try and do a back flip

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.890
on the solid ground,
or even on a trampoline

01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:37.330
if you don't know what you're doing

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:39.210
because very likely you'll get it wrong

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:40.363
and you'll get injured.

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:44.180
But if it's something that is closed loop

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.960
where you can repeat again and
again, and again and again,

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.370
that is advantageous
because you can perform

01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:52.980
many many repetitions and
you can start to focus

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.510
or learn to focus your attention

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:57.080
just on the pattern of movement.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.650
In other words, you can
learn to play the piano

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:02.480
just as fast or maybe even faster

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.010
by just focusing on the
sequence that you are moving

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:07.780
your digits, your fingers
and not the feedback.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.670
Now, I'm sure there are
music teachers out there

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:11.017
and piano teachers that are screaming,

01:04:11.017 --> 01:04:13.067
"No you're going to ruin the practice

01:04:13.067 --> 01:04:15.737
"that all of us have embedded in our minds

01:04:15.737 --> 01:04:17.010
"and in our students."

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:20.810
And I agree, at some
point you need to start

01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:23.130
including feedback about whether or not

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:24.310
things sound correct.

01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:26.630
But one of the beauties of skill learning

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:29.080
is that you can choose to parameterize it,

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.950
meaning you can choose to just
focus on the motor sequence

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:34.470
or just focus on the
sounds that are coming back

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.540
and then integrate those.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.840
And so we hear a lot about chunking,

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.500
about breaking things down
into their component parts.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.620
But one of the biggest
challenges for skill learning

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.800
is knowing where to place your attention.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.234
So to dial out again,
we're building a protocol

01:04:49.234 --> 01:04:50.850
across this episode, early sessions,

01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:52.930
maybe it's the first one,
maybe it's the first 10,

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:54.540
maybe it's the first 100.

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.250
It depends on how many
repetitions you're packing in.

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.030
But during those initial sessions,

01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:02.730
the key is to make many errors
to let the reward process

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:06.920
govern the plasticity, let the
errors open the plasticity.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.950
And then after the learning sessions,

01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:10.960
to let the brain go idle

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.270
at least for a short period of time

01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:13.820
and of course, to maximize sleep.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:16.910
As you start incorporating more sessions,

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:19.820
you start to gain some skill level,

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:22.050
learning to harness and
focus your attention

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:25.370
on particular features of the movement

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:28.900
independent of the
rewards and the feedback.

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.460
So the reward is no longer in
the tone coming from the piano

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.380
or whether or not you
struck the target correctly

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:38.150
but simply the motor
movement focusing your,

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:41.380
for instance in a dart throw,
on the action of your arm.

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:44.750
That is embedding the
plasticity in the motor pattern

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.640
most deeply, that's what's been shown

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.060
by the scientific literature.

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.970
I'm sure there are coaches
and teachers out there

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:52.850
that will entirely disagree
with me and that's great.

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:55.020
Please let me know what you prefer,

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.730
let me know where you think this is wrong

01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:00.310
and it rarely happens, but
let me know where you think

01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:01.870
this might be right as well.

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.730
So we're breaking the
learning process down

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:05.400
into its component parts.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.090
As we get more and more skilled,

01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:09.570
meaning as we make fewer and fewer errors

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:14.570
per a given session per unit
time, that's when attention

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:18.510
can start to migrate from one feature

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:20.620
such as the motor sequence
to another feature

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:25.620
which is perhaps one's
stance and another sequence,

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:28.080
component of the sequence,
which would be the result

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.010
that's one getting on
a trial to trial basis.

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:33.030
So changing it up each time.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:35.270
So maybe I served the tennis ball

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.620
and I'm focusing on where the ball lands

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.160
and then I'm focusing on the speed,

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.630
then I'm focusing on my grip,
then I'm focusing on my stance

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.930
from trial to trial.

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:47.140
But until we've mastered
the core motor movements

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.350
which has done session to session,

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:51.310
that at least according to the literature

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:55.250
that I have access to here,
seems to be suboptimal.

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:57.590
So hopefully this is
starting to make sense,

01:06:57.590 --> 01:07:01.410
which is that these connections
between upper motor neurons,

01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:04.240
lower motor neurons and
central pattern generators,

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.080
you can't attack them all at once.

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.094
You can't try and change them all at once.

01:07:08.094 --> 01:07:09.210
And so what we're doing is
we're breaking things down

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:11.320
into their component parts.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.523
Some of you may be wondering
about speed of movement.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.640
There are some data, meaning
some decent papers out there

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.060
showing that ultra slow movements,

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:26.050
performing a movement
essentially in slow motion

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:31.050
can be beneficial for enhancing
the rate of skill learning.

01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:35.030
However, at least from my
read of the literature,

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:38.090
it appears that ultra slow
movements should be performed

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:42.560
after some degree of proficiency
has already been gained

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.290
in that particular movement.

01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:46.080
Now that's not the way I
would have thought about it.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.480
I would have thought, well,
if you're learning how to do

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.730
a proper kick or a paunch in martial arts

01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:53.180
or something that ultra
slow movements at first

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:57.880
are going to be the way
that one can best learn

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.040
how to perform a movement

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.060
and then you just gradually
increase the speed.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.660
It turns out that's not the case

01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:05.410
and I probably should have known that.

01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:08.560
And you should probably know
that because it turns out

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.440
that when you do ultra slow movements,

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.410
two things aren't available to you.

01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:16.070
One is the proprioceptive
feedback is not accurate

01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.880
because of fast movements
of limbs are very different

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.810
than slow movements of limbs.

01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:21.920
So you don't get the opportunity

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.460
to build in the proprioceptive feedback.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:27.160
But the other reason why it doesn't work

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.470
is that it's too accurate,
you don't generate errors.

01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:34.130
And so the data that I was able to find

01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:38.000
show that very slow
movements can be beneficial

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.830
if one is already
proficient in a practice,

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:43.130
but very slow movements at the beginning

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:45.400
don't allow you to learn more quickly

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.060
because you never generate errors

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:50.780
and therefore the brain doesn't,
it's not open for change.

01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:54.670
The window for plasticity has
never swung open, so to speak.

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:56.970
So it brings us back to this theme

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.150
that errors allow for plasticity,

01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:00.840
correct performance of movements

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.150
or semi correct performance of
movements, cues the synapses

01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:08.570
in the brain areas and spinal
circuits that need to change.

01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:10.580
And then those changes occur in the period

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.860
immediately after skill
learning and in sleep.

01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:16.660
So super slow movements can be beneficial

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.570
once you already have some proficiencies.

01:09:18.570 --> 01:09:21.130
So this might be standing
in your living room

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:23.280
and just in ultra slow motion,

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.330
performing your tennis serve, learning to,

01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:27.420
or thinking about how
you're adjusting your elbow

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.960
and your arm and the trajectory
exactly how you were taught

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.340
by your tennis coach.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:34.300
But trying to learn it
that way from the outset

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:37.980
does not appear to be the
best way to learn a skill.

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:40.250
When should you start to
introduce slow learning?

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.680
Well, obviously talk to
your coaches about this,

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.570
but if you're doing this recreationally

01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:46.890
or you don't have a coach,
I realize many of you don't.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:50.200
I don't have a coach
for anything that I do.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.350
I'm going to have just navigating it

01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:54.660
by using the scientific literature.

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.850
It appears that once you're
hitting success rates

01:09:56.850 --> 01:10:00.830
of about 25 or 30%, that's
where the super slow movements

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.610
can start to be beneficial.

01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:05.750
But if you're still
performing things at a rate

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:09.200
of five or 10% correct
and the rest are errors,

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.440
then the super slow movements

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.210
are probably not going
to benefit you that much.

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:16.270
Also super slow movements
are not really applicable

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:18.060
to a lot of things.

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:21.170
For instance, you could
imagine throwing a dart

01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:23.270
super slow motion, but if you actually try

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:24.640
and throw an actual dart,

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.230
the dart's just going to
fall to the floor, obviously.

01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:30.300
So there are a number of
things like baseball bat swing

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.850
which you can practice
in super slow motion.

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:34.910
But if you try and do that
with an actual baseball

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:37.466
or softball or something like that,

01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:38.550
that's not going to give
you any kind of feedback

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:39.970
about how effective it was.

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:44.480
So super slow movements
or a decelerated movement

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:49.230
has its place but once you're
already performing things

01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:53.020
reasonably well like maybe
25 to 30% success rate.

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:56.640
And I've tried this, I actually,
I struggle with basketball

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.180
for whatever reason and
my free throw is terrible.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:02.310
So I practiced free throws
in super slow motion

01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:04.250
and I nailed them every time,

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:06.310
the problem is there's no ball.

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:09.320
Some of you already have a
fair degree of proficiency,

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:14.320
of skill in a given practice
or sport or instrument.

01:11:15.010 --> 01:11:18.150
And if you're in this sort
of advanced intermediate

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:22.680
or advanced levels of
proficiency for something,

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.050
there is a practice that you
can find interesting data for

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:30.700
in the literature, which
involves metronoming.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:35.700
So this you'll realize relates
to generating repetitions

01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:39.180
and it relates to the tone experiment

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:41.970
where it doesn't really
matter what your attention

01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:43.960
is cued to as long as you are performing

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.850
many many reps of the motor sequence.

01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:49.960
You can use a metronome and
obviously musicians do this,

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.340
but athletes can do this too.

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:54.870
You can use a metronome to set the cadence

01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:56.790
of your repetitions.

01:11:56.790 --> 01:12:01.066
Now for swimmers, there's
actually a device.

01:12:01.066 --> 01:12:01.899
I was able to find online,

01:12:01.899 --> 01:12:02.750
I forgot what the brand name was

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:05.620
and that's not what this is
about, but that actually goes

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:08.110
in the swim cap that can cue you

01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:10.180
to when you need to
perform another stroke.

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:14.180
And for runners, there are
other metronome type devices

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.930
that through headphones or
through a tone in the room

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:19.000
if you're running
indoors or on a treadmill

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.750
we'll cue you to when you basically

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.453
you need to lift your heels.

01:12:22.453 --> 01:12:24.140
And if you do that, what athletes find

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.360
is they can perform more repetitions,

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:29.610
they can generate more output,
you can increase speed.

01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:31.270
A number of really interesting
things are being done

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:33.457
with auditory metronoming.

01:12:33.457 --> 01:12:34.760
And then I'm involved in
a little bit of work now

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.900
that hopefully I'll be
able to report back to you

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.330
about using stroboscopic metronoming.

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:42.050
So actually changing the speed
of the visual environment.

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:44.640
These are fun experiments,
basically changing

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.130
one's perception of how fast
they're moving through space

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:49.010
by playing with the visual system,

01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:50.740
something for a future discussion.

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.670
But you can start to
use auditory metronoming

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:57.570
for generating more
movements per unit time

01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:00.830
and generating more errors
and therefore more successes

01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:02.670
and more neuroplasticity.

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:04.890
There are a number of
different apps out there.

01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:07.090
I found several free
apps where you can set in

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:08.920
a metronome pace, or
it might be tick, tick,

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.330
tick, tick, tick, tick.

01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:11.810
That's a little fast for most things,

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:14.320
but you can imagine if this were darts

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.410
or this were golf swings
that it might be tick,

01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:20.960
tick, tick, tick or something
more like tick, tick.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.330
And every time the
metronome goes, you swing.

01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:25.660
Every time the metronome
goes, you throw a dart.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.220
Actually there's some wild
experiments out there.

01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.910
You know there's a world
championship of cup stacking.

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:33.140
There's a young lady who I
saw could take all these cups

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:35.330
spread out on a table and
basically just stack them

01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:37.527
into the perfect pyramid in
the least amount of times

01:13:37.527 --> 01:13:38.550
and all the kids go wild.

01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:41.010
This is something I'd
never thought to pursue

01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:43.320
and frankly never will pursue

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.960
unless my life depends
on it for some reason,

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.300
but it's really impressive.

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:48.120
And if you look at the sequence

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.290
'cause these have been recorded,

01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:51.610
you can look this up on YouTube.

01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:54.630
What you'll find is that
these expert cup stackers,

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:56.910
it's just all about error elimination.

01:13:56.910 --> 01:14:00.070
But they're two metronomic
and auditory cues

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:02.680
can actually cue them to
pick up the cups faster

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.480
than they would ordinarily
and to learn to do that.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.530
You can do this for anything.

01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:08.960
I think cup stacking
is probably not a skill

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.110
most of you are interested in doing,

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:15.110
but for any skill, if you
figure out at what rate

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:17.590
you are performing
repetitions per unit time

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:19.280
and you want to increase that slightly,

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.430
you set a metronome
which is slightly faster

01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:24.520
than your current rate and
you just start generating

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.370
more repetitions.

01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:27.950
Now what's interesting
about this and is cool

01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:30.730
is it relates back to the experiment

01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:34.980
from Lappe and colleagues,
which is your attention

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:39.440
is now harnessed to the
tone, to the metronome,

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.000
not necessarily to what you're doing

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.198
in terms of the motor movement.

01:14:43.198 --> 01:14:44.960
And so really you need
a bit of proficiency.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.150
Again, this is for people
who are in intermediate

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:49.120
or advanced intermediate or advanced.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.540
But what you're essentially
doing is you're creating

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:55.310
an outside pressure, a
contingency so that you generate,

01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:56.720
again, more errors.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.750
So it's all about the errors that you get.

01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:00.690
Now, these aren't errors
where all the cups tumble

01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:02.700
or you have to stop or you can't keep up,

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.490
you have to set the pace just a little bit

01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:06.970
beyond what you currently can do.

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:09.030
And when you do that,
you're essentially forcing

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:11.180
the nervous system to make
errors and correct the errors

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.760
inside of the session.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.930
I find this really interesting
because what it means

01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:17.170
is, again you've got sensory perception,

01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:18.100
what you're paying attention to,

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.840
proprioception where your
limbs are and the motor neurons

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.940
in your upper lower motor neurons

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.880
and central pattern generators.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.267
And you can't pay attention to,

01:15:26.267 --> 01:15:27.777
"Well, they're my upper motor neurons,

01:15:27.777 --> 01:15:28.810
"they're my lower motor neurons."

01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:31.321
Forget that, you're not going to do that.

01:15:31.321 --> 01:15:33.890
You can't pay attention to
your proprioception too much.

01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:35.550
That would be the super slow motion

01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:37.530
would be the proprioception.

01:15:37.530 --> 01:15:41.350
But you have to harness
your attention to something.

01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:42.500
And if you harness your attention

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.680
to this outside
contingency, this metronome

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.610
that's firing off and saying,
now go, now go, now go.

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:51.520
Not only can you increase the
number of repetitions, errors

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.850
and successes, but for some
reason and we don't know why,

01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:59.320
the regular cadence of
the tone of the metronome

01:16:00.456 --> 01:16:02.720
and the fact that you are
anchoring your movements

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.190
to some external force,
to some external pressure

01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:10.420
or cue seems to accelerate the plasticity

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.960
and the changes and the
acquisition of skills

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.160
beyond what it would be if
you just did the same number

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.740
of repetitions without
that outside pressure.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.420
We don't know exactly
what the mechanism is.

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.230
Presumably it's neurochemical,
like there's something

01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:25.410
about keeping up with
a timer or with a pace

01:16:25.410 --> 01:16:28.160
that presumably and I'm speculating here,

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.480
causes the release of
particular chemicals.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.950
But I think it's really cool.

01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:34.220
Metronomes, they're totally inexpensive,

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:36.460
at least the ones that
you use outside of water

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:37.490
are very inexpensive.

01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:39.220
You can find these free apps,

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.840
you can use a musical metronome.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.930
So metronomes are a powerful tool as well

01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:45.630
in particular for speed work.

01:16:45.630 --> 01:16:47.970
So for sprinting or swimming or running

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:52.100
where the goal is to generate more strokes

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:55.860
or more efficient strokes
or more steps, et cetera.

01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.450
The rate of the metronome obviously

01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:59.300
is going to be very important.

01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:00.950
Sometimes you're trying
to lengthen your stride,

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.930
sometimes you're trying
to take fewer strokes

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:05.480
but glide further in
the pool for instance.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.730
But the value of occasionally

01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:11.690
just the number of repetitions,
the number of strokes

01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:14.340
or steps, et cetera per unit time is also

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.270
that you're training the
central pattern generators

01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:18.573
to operate at that higher speed.

01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:21.280
One of the sports has
kind of interesting to me

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.400
is speed walking.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.610
It's not one I engage in or
ever planned to engage in,

01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:27.990
but if you've ever tried
to really speed walk,

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:30.160
it's actually difficult
to walk very very fast

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.750
without breaking into a run.

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:34.200
All animals have these
kinds of crossover points

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.770
where you go.

01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:39.680
I think with horses it's
like it was that they trot,

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.000
then they gallop on, or
what's the next thing.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.240
Clearly, I don't know
anything about horses

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.750
except that they're beautiful
and I liked them very much.

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:51.010
But they break into a
different kind of stride.

01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:52.290
And that's because you shift over

01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:55.090
to different central pattern generators.

01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:57.950
So when you're walking or a
horse is moving very slowly

01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:00.452
and then it breaks into a jog

01:18:00.452 --> 01:18:03.790
and then into a full sprint
or gallop for the horse,

01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:04.970
you're actually engaging different

01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:06.393
central pattern generators.

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:08.110
And those central pattern generators

01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:10.940
always have a range of
speeds that they're happiest

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.050
to function at.

01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:16.163
So with the metronoming
for speed purposes,

01:18:16.163 --> 01:18:19.050
what you do is you can
basically bring the activity

01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:20.350
of those central pattern generators

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:24.828
into their upper range and
maybe even extend their range.

01:18:24.828 --> 01:18:25.720
And there's a fascinating biology

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.934
of how central pattern
generators work together.

01:18:28.934 --> 01:18:30.820
There's coupling of central
pattern generators, et cetera

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.333
in order to achieve maximum
speeds and et cetera.

01:18:34.333 --> 01:18:35.770
It's a topic for a kind
of an advanced session.

01:18:35.770 --> 01:18:37.983
Costa loves this topic, he just barked.

01:18:39.418 --> 01:18:40.570
And he loves it so much, he barked again.

01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:43.060
In any event, the metronome
is a powerful tool,

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.200
again for more advanced practitioners

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.350
or for advanced
intermediate practitioners.

01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:51.560
But it's interesting
because it brings back

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.270
the point that what we
put our attention to

01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:57.170
while we're still learning is important

01:18:57.170 --> 01:18:59.460
to the extent that it's on one thing

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:02.110
at least for the moment or trial to trial,

01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:07.110
but that what we focus our
attention on can be external,

01:19:08.383 --> 01:19:10.420
it can be internal and
ultimately the skill learning

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.640
is where all that is brought together.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.120
So let's talk about where
skill learning occurs

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.896
in the nervous system.

01:19:16.896 --> 01:19:19.310
And then I'm going to give you a really,

01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:22.520
what I think is a really cool tool

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:26.170
that can increase flexibility
and range of motion

01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:27.860
based on this particular brain area.

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:30.110
It's a tool that I used and
when I first heard about,

01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:32.140
I did not believe would work.

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:34.380
This is not a hack, this
is actually anchored deeply

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:37.670
in the biology of a particular
brain region that we all have

01:19:39.278 --> 01:19:40.890
whose meaning is mini brain.

01:19:40.890 --> 01:19:43.430
And that mini brain that we all have

01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:45.320
is called your cerebellum.

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.100
The cerebellum is called the mini brain

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.209
because it's in the back of your brain.

01:19:49.209 --> 01:19:50.042
It looks like a little mini version

01:19:50.042 --> 01:19:50.940
of the rest of your brain.

01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:53.520
It's an absolutely incredible structure

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.960
that's involved in movement.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.323
It also has a lot of non-movement
associated functions.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:04.920
In brief, the cerebellum
gets input from your senses,

01:20:07.685 --> 01:20:09.600
particularly, your eyes and pays attention

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.450
to where your eyes are in
space, what you're looking at.

01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:16.280
It basically takes information
about three aspects

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.240
of your eyes and eye
movements which are occurring

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:25.060
when your head goes like
this, which is called pitch.

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.173
So this is pitch.

01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:29.000
For those of you that are
listening I'm just nodding

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.630
up and down then there's yaw,

01:20:31.630 --> 01:20:34.430
which is like shaking your
head, no, from side to side.

01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:37.460
And then there's roll,
which is that like sometimes

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.563
if you see a primate, like
a Marmoset or something,

01:20:41.426 --> 01:20:42.730
they will roll their head
when they look at you.

01:20:42.730 --> 01:20:45.070
Actually, the reason they
do that is it helps generate

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:47.770
depth perception, it's a kind
of form of motion parallax

01:20:47.770 --> 01:20:49.120
if you're curious why they do that.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.490
It's not to look cute, they do
it because when they do that,

01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:54.540
even if you're stationary
and they're stationary,

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.270
they get better depth perception

01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:59.900
as to how far away from them you are.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:03.180
So you've got pitch, yaw and roll.

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:06.550
And as you move your head
and as you move your body

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:10.420
and you move through space,
the image on your retina moves,

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:12.200
pitch, yaw on roll in some combination,

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.480
that information is
relayed to your cerebellum.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.820
So it's rich with visual information.

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:19.810
There's also a map of your body surface

01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:22.680
and your movements and
timing in the cerebellum.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.690
So it's an incredible
structure that brings together

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:28.035
timing of movements,
which limbs are moving

01:21:28.035 --> 01:21:30.700
and has proprioceptive information.

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.610
It really is a mini brain,

01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:34.820
it's just the coolest
little structure back there.

01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:36.440
And in humans, it's
actually not that little,

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.750
it's just an incredible structure.

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:41.870
Now, all this information
is integrated there,

01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:46.840
but what most people don't tell
us is that a lot of learning

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:49.710
of motor sequences of skill
learning that involves timing

01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:51.263
occurs in the cerebellum.

01:21:52.210 --> 01:21:55.160
Now, you can't really use that information

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.630
except to know that after you
learn something pretty well,

01:21:57.630 --> 01:22:00.820
it's handed off or kind of
handled by your cerebellum,

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:02.710
but there is something that
you can do with your cerebellum

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:05.720
to increase range of
motion and flexibility.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.850
Much of our flexibility, believe it or not

01:22:08.850 --> 01:22:12.500
is not because our tendons
are particular length

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:16.530
or a elasticity, although
that plays some role,

01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:18.600
it's not because our muscles are short.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.030
I don't know what that would even mean.

01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:22.150
Some people have longer muscle bellies

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:25.330
or shorter muscle bellies,
but your muscles always

01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:29.140
essentially span the
entire length of the bone

01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:32.520
or limb or close to it,
along with your tendons.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:36.930
But has to do with the
neural innervation of muscle

01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:39.240
and the fact that when
muscles are elongated,

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.960
there's a point at which
they won't stretch out

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:45.680
any longer and the nerves
fire, and they shut down

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:48.260
that you actually have inhibitory pathways

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:51.160
that prevent you from
contracting the muscles

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:55.000
or from extending them, from
stretching them out any more.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.530
So you can do this right now.

01:22:57.530 --> 01:23:00.573
If you're driving, don't do
it because unless you have

01:23:00.573 --> 01:23:02.251
a self-driving car, you'll
need to take your hands

01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:03.084
off the steering.

01:23:03.084 --> 01:23:08.084
But because of the way that
vision and your muscles

01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:13.730
are represented in your cerebellum,

01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:17.430
it turns out that your
range of visual motion

01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:22.390
and your range of vision,
literally how wide a field of view

01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:27.390
you take impacts how far
you can extend your limbs.

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:29.770
So we'll talk about this in a second

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:33.610
exactly how to do this and explore this.

01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:37.940
But as you move through
space, as you walk forward

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:39.830
or you walk backward,
or you tilt your head

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:42.780
or you learn a skill, or you
just operate in the normal ways

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:45.290
throughout your day,
driving, biking, et cetera,

01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:47.360
your eyes are generating
spontaneous movements

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.560
to offset visual slip.

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.720
In other words, you don't
see the world as blurry

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.850
even though you're
moving because your eyes

01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:55.840
are generating low
compensatory eye movements

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.140
to offset your motion.

01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:59.400
So if I spin, we could do this experiment.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.270
There's a fun experiment
we do with medical students

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:05.660
where you spin them around in
a chair with their eyes closed

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:08.430
and then you stop and you
have them open their eyes

01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:11.420
and their eyes are going
like this, is nystagmus.

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:13.750
I don't suggest you do this experiment.

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:16.090
When we were kids, we did
a different experiment

01:24:16.090 --> 01:24:18.780
which was to take a stick
and to look at the top

01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:21.400
of the stick and to
spin around on the lawn

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.030
looking at the top of the
stick then put it down

01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:24.370
on the ground and try and jump over it.

01:24:24.370 --> 01:24:25.730
And you ended up like jumping to the side,

01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:27.460
you miss the thing entirely.

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:32.410
The reason those two "experiments"
which I hope you don't do

01:24:33.847 --> 01:24:34.700
or for somebody else to do.

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:38.430
The reason they work is because
normally your eye movements

01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:41.030
and your balance and your limb
movements are coordinated.

01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:43.630
But when you spin around
looking up at the stick,

01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:45.350
what you're doing is
you're fixating your eyes

01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:47.480
on one location while you're moving.

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.910
And then when you stop
those two mechanisms

01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:53.180
are completely uncoupled
and it's like being thrown

01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:54.313
into outer space.

01:24:55.732 --> 01:24:56.565
I've never been to outer space,

01:24:56.565 --> 01:24:59.103
but probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity.

01:25:00.210 --> 01:25:02.860
If you spin around in your
chair with your eyes closed,

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:05.090
you're not giving the visual
input that you're spinning.

01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:08.110
And then you open the eyes
and then the eyes only have

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:11.808
what we call the vestibular,
your eyes jolting

01:25:11.808 --> 01:25:12.897
back and forth, back and forth.

01:25:12.897 --> 01:25:13.990
Again, these aren't
experiments you need to do

01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:16.060
'cause I just told you the result.

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:19.980
However, if you want to
extend your range of motion,

01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:22.370
you can do that by...

01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:24.510
These things always look
goofy, but at this point

01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:26.630
I'm just kind of used
to doing these things.

01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:28.450
If I want to extend my range of movement,

01:25:28.450 --> 01:25:31.053
first, I want to measure
my range of motion.

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:33.690
If you're listening what I'm
doing is I'm stretching out

01:25:33.690 --> 01:25:37.550
my arms like a T on either side

01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:40.350
and I'm trying to push
them as far back as I can,

01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:43.070
which for me feels like it's
in line with my shoulders

01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:44.040
and I can't get much further.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.810
I'm not really super flexible

01:25:45.810 --> 01:25:50.803
nor am I particularly
inflexible at least physically.

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:54.390
So what I would then do is stop.

01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:57.440
I would move my eyes to the far periphery.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.540
So I'm moving my eyes
all the way to the left

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:02.130
while keeping my head and body stationary.

01:26:02.130 --> 01:26:05.810
I'm trying to look over my
left shoulder as far as I can

01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:07.920
then off to the right.

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:11.450
It's a little awkward to
do this, then up then down

01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:14.640
but I'm mostly going to just focus on left

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.840
and then right.

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.530
Now what that's doing
is it's sending a signal

01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:22.960
to my cerebellum that my field
of view is way over to there

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.450
and way over to there.

01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:26.760
Remember your visual
attention has an aperture.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.840
It can be narrow, or it can be broad.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.100
And I've talked about some of the benefits

01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:31.680
of taking a broad visual aperture

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:33.440
in order to relax the nervous system.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.700
This is just moving my eyes, not my head,

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.880
like I just did for a
second, from side to side.

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.320
Now I can retest.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:43.210
And actually you get about
a five to 15 degree increase

01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:44.660
in your range of motion.

01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.466
Now I'm doing this for you.

01:26:46.466 --> 01:26:47.717
You can say, "Well, he
gamed it 'cause he knew

01:26:47.717 --> 01:26:49.570
"the result that he was hoping for."

01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:51.160
But you can try this.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.710
And you can do this for legs too.

01:26:53.710 --> 01:26:55.450
You can do this for any limb essentially.

01:26:55.450 --> 01:26:58.196
And that's it's purely cerebellar.

01:26:58.196 --> 01:27:01.300
And it's because the proprioceptive visual

01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:04.820
and limb movement feedback converge

01:27:05.681 --> 01:27:08.390
in the ways that we
control our muscle spindles

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:10.750
and the way we control the
muscle fibers and the tendons

01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:13.604
and essentially you can
get bigger range of motion.

01:27:13.604 --> 01:27:15.170
So actually we'll warm up before exercise

01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:18.260
or before skill learning by
both doing movements for my body

01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:20.290
but also moving my eyes from side to side

01:27:20.290 --> 01:27:22.450
in order to generate
larger range of motion

01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:24.850
if range of motion is something
that I'm interested in.

01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:28.280
So that's a fun one that you
can play with a little bit

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.820
and it's purely cerebellar.

01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:33.110
Some other time we'll get back
into a cerebellar function.

01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:35.510
There's all sorts of just incredible stuff

01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:37.250
that you can do with cerebellum.

01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:39.930
I talked in an earlier
episode on neuro-plasticity

01:27:39.930 --> 01:27:44.180
about how you can disrupt
your vestibular world.

01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:49.180
In other words, by getting
into modes of acceleration,

01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:52.283
moving through space where
you're tilted in certain ways,

01:27:53.283 --> 01:27:54.980
it can open up the windows for plasticity

01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:56.330
and yet other ways.

01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:59.150
So you can check that out, it's
one of the earlier episodes

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:01.600
on neuroplasticity
everything's timestamped.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.360
But meanwhile, if you want to
expand your range of motion

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.520
before doing skill learning or
afterward, this is a fun one.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.060
It's also kind of neat because
I have this kind of aversion

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:12.240
to stretching work.

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.210
It never seems like something I want to do

01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:15.740
and so I always put it off.

01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:19.650
So if I start with the
visual practice of expanding

01:28:19.650 --> 01:28:22.200
my field of view to off to
one side or the other side

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.680
or up or down, then what
I find is I'm naturally

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.513
more flexible.

01:28:25.513 --> 01:28:26.760
I'm not naturally more flexible.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.570
What's happened is I've
expanded my range of motion.

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:33.253
Let's talk about visualization
and mental rehearsal.

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:35.680
I've been asked about this a lot,

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:39.180
and I think it relates
back to that kind of matrix

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:43.130
Hollywood idea that we can
just be embedded with a skill.

01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:45.280
Although in this case, in fairness,

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:47.700
visualization involves some work.

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:50.310
And I've talked about
this on an earlier episode

01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:53.040
that some people find it very hard

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:56.130
to mentally visualize things.

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:57.790
And some people find it very easy.

01:28:57.790 --> 01:29:00.660
There was great work that
was done in the 1960s

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:04.960
by Roger Shepherd at
Stanford and by others,

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.930
looking at people's ability to rotate

01:29:07.930 --> 01:29:10.310
three-dimensional objects in their mind.

01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:12.176
And some people really good at this

01:29:12.176 --> 01:29:13.009
and some people are less good at this.

01:29:13.009 --> 01:29:16.340
And one can get better
at it by repeating it.

01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:18.130
But the question we're
going to deal with today

01:29:18.130 --> 01:29:22.293
is does it help, does it
let you learn things faster?

01:29:23.304 --> 01:29:26.780
And indeed the answer
appears to be yes, it can.

01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:31.440
However, despite what you've
heard, it is not as good.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.840
It is not a total replacement

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.423
for physical performance itself.

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.910
So I'm going to be really
concrete about this.

01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:43.610
I hear all the time that just imagining

01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:46.490
contracting a muscle can
lead to the same gains

01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:48.500
as actually contracting that muscle.

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:51.890
Just imagining a skill can
lead to the same increases

01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:55.370
in performance as actually
executing that skill.

01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:57.780
And that's simply not the case.

01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:02.360
However, it can supplement
or support physical training

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.390
and skill learning in ways
that are quite powerful.

01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:07.430
One of the more
interesting studies on this

01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:10.990
was from Rang Ganason at all,

01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:12.853
forgive me for the pronunciation.

01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:17.180
This was a slightly older paper, 2004,

01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:19.310
but nonetheless was one that I thought

01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:21.270
had particularly impressive results

01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:25.440
and included all the
appropriate controls, et cetera.

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.030
And what they did is they
looked at 30 subjects.

01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:30.460
They divide them into different groups.

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:34.480
They had one group perform
essentially finger flection.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:36.830
So it actually sort of the
imagine if you're just listening

01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:39.303
to this, the come here a finger movement.

01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:45.020
They also had elbow flection,
so bicep curl type movement.

01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:49.960
And they either had subjects
do a actual physical movement

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.690
against resistance, or to
imagine moving their finger

01:30:53.690 --> 01:30:56.010
or their wrist towards the shoulder,

01:30:56.010 --> 01:30:58.010
meaning at the bending at the elbow

01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:59.793
towards actual resistance.

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:02.330
Just to make a long story short,

01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:07.000
what they found was that
there were increases

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.870
in this finger, adduction
strength, abduction,

01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:14.550
excuse me, strength of about
35% and the elbow flection

01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:19.550
strength by about 13.5%,
which are pretty impressive

01:31:20.610 --> 01:31:23.081
considering that was just done mentally.

01:31:23.081 --> 01:31:25.631
So they had people imagine
moving against a weight,

01:31:26.653 --> 01:31:30.490
a very heavyweight or had
imagined people moving their wrist

01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:33.520
towards their shoulder
against a very heavyweight.

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:34.780
But again, they weren't doing it,

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.243
they were just imagining it.

01:31:37.388 --> 01:31:39.490
Other experiments looked at the brain

01:31:39.490 --> 01:31:42.020
and what was happening in
the brain during this time.

01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:44.110
So we'll talk about that in a moment.

01:31:44.110 --> 01:31:47.880
But essentially what they
found were improvements

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:52.880
in strength of anywhere from 13.5 to 35%.

01:31:53.130 --> 01:31:56.530
However, the actual
physical training group,

01:31:56.530 --> 01:31:59.080
the groups that actually moved their wrist

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.560
or moved their finger against
an actual physical weight

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.340
had improvements of about 53%.

01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:09.010
So this repeats over and over
throughout the literature

01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:13.150
mental rehearsal can cause
increases in strength.

01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:18.150
It can create increases in
skill acquisition and learning,

01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:22.430
but they are never as great if done alone

01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:26.930
as compared to the
actual physical execution

01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:28.710
of those movements or
the physical movement

01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:32.160
of those weights, which
shouldn't come as so surprising.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:34.127
However, if we step back and we say,

01:32:34.127 --> 01:32:37.680
"Well, what is the source
of this improvement?"

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.786
You might not care what the source is

01:32:39.786 --> 01:32:41.535
because I could tell
you it's one brain area

01:32:41.535 --> 01:32:42.627
or another brain area.

01:32:42.627 --> 01:32:43.484
What difference would it make?

01:32:43.484 --> 01:32:45.460
But again, if you can understand
mechanism a little bit,

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:47.960
you're in a position to create newer

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:49.960
and even better protocols.

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:54.300
What mental rehearsal appears
to do is engage the activity

01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:56.470
of those upper motor
neurons that we talked about

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:58.810
way back at the beginning of the episode.

01:32:58.810 --> 01:33:00.260
Remember you have upper motor neurons

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:01.890
that control deliberate action,

01:33:01.890 --> 01:33:03.720
you've got lower motor
neurons that actually

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.440
connect to the muscles
and move those muscles

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:07.340
and you have central pattern generators.

01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:10.200
Mental rehearsal, closing
one's eyes typically

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:13.250
and thinking about a
particular sequence of movement

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:18.250
and visualizing it in one's "mind's eye"

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:21.380
creates activation of
the upper motor neurons

01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:25.750
that's very similar if not the
same as the actual movement.

01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:28.050
And that makes sense because
the upper motor neurons

01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:30.310
are all about the command for movement.

01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:33.160
They are not the ones that
actually execute the movement.

01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:35.990
Remember, upper motor neurons are the ones

01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:37.610
that generate the command for movement,

01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:38.990
not the actual movement.

01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:40.630
The ones that generate the actual movement

01:33:40.630 --> 01:33:41.840
are the lower motor neurons

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.960
and the central pattern generators.

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.570
So visualization is a powerful tool.

01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:48.680
How can you use visualization?

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:52.700
Well, in this study, they
had people perform this

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:54.053
five days a week.

01:33:55.556 --> 01:33:57.480
I believe that it was 15.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:00.840
Yes, it was 15 minutes
per day, five days a week

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.700
for 12 weeks.

01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:04.200
So that's a lot of mental rehearsal.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.590
It's not a ton of time each
day, 15 minutes per day.

01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:08.300
But sitting down, closing your eyes

01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:13.140
and imagining going through
a particular skill practice

01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:14.783
or moving a weight.

01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:19.360
Maybe it's playing keys on
a piano if that's your thing

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:22.610
or strings on a guitar,
for 15 minutes a day,

01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:25.610
five days per week for
12 weeks is considerable.

01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:27.973
I think most people, given the fact

01:34:27.973 --> 01:34:30.770
that the actual practice,
the physical practice

01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:34.360
is going to lead to larger improvements,

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:37.350
greater improvements then
would the mental training

01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:40.030
would opt for the actual
physical training.

01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:41.840
But of course, if you're on a plane

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.510
and you don't have access to your guitar

01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:44.760
and you're certainly not
going to be sprinting

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.250
up and down the aisle
or you are very serious

01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:52.327
about your craft and you want
to accelerate performance

01:34:52.327 --> 01:34:53.993
of your craft or strength increases

01:34:53.993 --> 01:34:57.070
or something of that sort,
then augmenting or adding in

01:34:57.070 --> 01:35:00.750
the visualization training
very likely will compound

01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:03.350
the effects of the
actual physical training.

01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:06.480
There are not a lot of studies
looking at how visualization

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.330
on top of pure physical training

01:35:10.330 --> 01:35:13.580
can increase the rates of learning

01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:16.210
and consolidation of learning, et cetera.

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:18.900
It's actually a hard study to
do because hard to control for

01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:20.810
because what would you do in its place.

01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:23.510
You would probably add
actual physical training

01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:26.560
and then that's always going
to lead to greater effects.

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:30.310
So the point is if you want
to use visualization training,

01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:34.590
great, but forget the idea
that visualization training

01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:37.760
is as good as the actual behavior.

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:38.750
You hear this all the time.

01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:41.290
People say, do you know that
if you imagine an experience

01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:42.770
to your brain and to your body,

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:45.090
it's exactly the same as
the actual experience.

01:35:45.090 --> 01:35:46.110
Absolutely not.

01:35:46.110 --> 01:35:47.700
This is not the way the
nervous system works.

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.760
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to burst anybody's bubble,

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:52.440
but your bubble is made of myths.

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:56.420
And the fact of the
matter is that the brain,

01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:59.460
when it executes a movement is generating

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:01.882
proprioceptive feedback.

01:36:01.882 --> 01:36:04.460
And that proprioceptive
feedback is critically involved

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.790
in generating our sense of the experience

01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:08.670
and in things like learning.

01:36:08.670 --> 01:36:12.810
So I don't say this because
I don't like the idea

01:36:12.810 --> 01:36:14.260
that visualization couldn't work.

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:16.283
In fact visualization does work,

01:36:17.648 --> 01:36:18.481
but it doesn't work as well,

01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:20.600
it doesn't create the same millu,

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.360
the same chemical millu,
the same environment

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.350
as actual, physically
engaging in the behavior,

01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:30.580
the skill the resistance
training, et cetera.

01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.520
And I'd be willing to
wager that the same is true

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:36.013
for experiences of all kinds.

01:36:36.013 --> 01:36:40.050
PTSD is this incredibly
unfortunate circumstance

01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:43.670
in which there's a replay
often of the traumatic event

01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:45.510
that feels very real.

01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:47.640
But that's not to say
that the replay itself

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:50.030
is the same as the actual event.

01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:52.130
And of course, PTSD needs to be dealt with

01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:57.040
with the utmost level of
seriousness, it should be treated.

01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.200
In fact, my lab works on
these sorts of things,

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:03.600
but my point about visualization
and imagining something

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:06.390
not being the same as
the actual experience

01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:09.000
is grounded in this
idea of proprioception.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.070
And the fact that feedback
to the cerebellum,

01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:12.830
the cerebellum, talking to
other areas of the brain

01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:14.970
are critically involved in communicating

01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:16.410
to the rest of our nervous system.

01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:18.870
That not just that we believe
something is happening

01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:20.530
but something is actually happening.

01:37:20.530 --> 01:37:22.310
And in the case of muscle loads,

01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:25.010
muscles actually feeling tension,

01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:28.500
the actual feeling of
tension in the muscle.

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:30.940
The contracting of the
muscle under that tension

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:34.410
is part of the important
adaptation process.

01:37:34.410 --> 01:37:36.500
In a future episode, we'll
talk about hypertrophy

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:38.650
and how that works at the
level of upper motor neurons,

01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:41.030
lower motor neurons and muscle itself.

01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:44.100
But for now just know that
visualization can work.

01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:46.100
It doesn't work as well
as real physical training

01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:50.420
and practice, but these effects of 35%

01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:54.020
or 13.5% increases are
pretty considerable.

01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:56.970
They're just not as great
as the 53% increases

01:37:56.970 --> 01:37:58.940
that come from actual physical training.

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.500
For those of you that are interested

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:03.937
in some of this skill
learning that more relates

01:38:03.937 --> 01:38:07.430
to musical training, but also
how cadence and metronomes

01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:11.600
and tones, et cetera, can
support physical learning.

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.710
If you're interested in that,
if are you a fussy and autos,

01:38:14.710 --> 01:38:17.410
there is a wonderful
review, also published

01:38:17.410 --> 01:38:20.320
in the Journal Neuron
again, excellent journal

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.320
by Herholz and Zatorre,
that's H-E-R-H-O-L-Z

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.910
and Zatorre, Z-A-T-O-R-R-E.

01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:34.910
That really describes in
detail how musical training

01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:37.660
can impact all sorts of different things

01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:41.620
and how cadence training,
whether or not with tones

01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:44.520
or auditory feedback
and things of that sort

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:48.730
carries over to not just
instrumental music training

01:38:48.730 --> 01:38:51.460
but also physical skill
learning of various kinds.

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:52.810
So if you want to do the deep dive,

01:38:52.810 --> 01:38:55.050
that would be the place you
can find it easily online.

01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:57.010
It's available as a complete article

01:38:57.010 --> 01:38:58.780
free of charge, et cetera.

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:01.650
Many of you are probably
asking what can I take

01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:03.890
in order to accelerate skill learning?

01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:06.220
Well, the conditions are going to vary,

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:07.800
but motivation is key.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.530
You have to show up to
the training session

01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:13.420
motivated enough to focus your attention

01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:15.470
and to perform a lot of repetitions

01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:17.230
in the training sequence.

01:39:17.230 --> 01:39:19.370
That's just a prerequisite.

01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:20.760
There's no pill that's
going to allow you to do

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:23.330
fewer repetitions and
extract more learning

01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:24.480
out of fewer repetitions.

01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.380
It's actually more a question
of what are the conditions

01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:30.870
that you can create for yourself
such that you can generate

01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:32.620
more repetitions per unit time.

01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:35.154
I think that's the right
way to think about it.

01:39:35.154 --> 01:39:36.410
What are the conditions
that you can create

01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:38.190
for yourself in your mind and in your body

01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:40.600
that are going to allow you to focus?

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.900
And I've talked about focus and plasticity

01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:44.610
and motivation in previous episodes.

01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:47.380
Please see those episodes if
you have questions about that.

01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:50.240
I've detailed a lot of tools
in the underlying science.

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.960
So for some people, it might
be drinking a cup of coffee

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:54.910
and getting hydrated before
the training session.

01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:56.810
For some of you, it
might be avoiding coffee

01:39:56.810 --> 01:39:57.900
because it makes you too jittery

01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:59.620
and your attention jumps
all over the place.

01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:01.070
It's going to vary tremendously.

01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:04.420
There is no magic pill
that's going to allow you

01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:07.720
to get more out of less, that's
just not going to happen.

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.150
It's simply not going to happen.

01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:10.580
You're not going to get more learning

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.980
out of fewer repetitions or less time.

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:15.890
However, there are a few compounds

01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:20.360
I think are worth mentioning
because of their ability

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.640
to improve the actual
physical performance,

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:25.640
the actual execution of
certain types of movements.

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:27.680
And some of these have also been shown

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.660
to improve cognitive function,

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.490
especially in older population.

01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:34.070
So I'd be remiss if I didn't
at least mention them.

01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:36.120
I'm only going to mention
one today in fact.

01:40:37.459 --> 01:40:38.310
The one that's particularly interesting

01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:42.430
and for which there really
are a lot of data is alpha GPC

01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:45.840
and I'm going to attempt to pronounce

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.430
what alpha GPC actually is.

01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:49.933
It's alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine.

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.970
Alpha GPC, alpha
glycerylphosphorylcholine.

01:40:53.970 --> 01:40:55.870
See, if I keep doing it
over and over repetitions,

01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:58.128
alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine.

01:40:58.128 --> 01:40:58.961
There I made an error.

01:40:58.961 --> 01:41:02.470
Okay, so the point is that alpha GPC,

01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:04.100
which is at least in the United States

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:08.770
is sold over the counter
typically is taken in dosages

01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:11.660
of about 300 to 600 milligrams.

01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:14.420
That's a single dose or
have been shown to do

01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:18.040
a number of things that for
some of you might be beneficial.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.850
One is to enhance power output.

01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:22.490
So if you're engaging in
something like Shotput throwing

01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:25.470
or resistance training or sprinting

01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:28.100
or something where you have
to generate a lot of power,

01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:30.700
maybe you're doing rock
climbing, but you're working

01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:32.550
on a particular aspect
of your rock climbing

01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:36.190
that involves generating a
lot of force, a lot of power.

01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:40.700
Well then in theory, alpha GPC
could be beneficial to you.

01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:44.290
For the cognitive effects,
the dosages are much higher

01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:47.990
up to 1200 milligrams daily
divided into three doses

01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:49.730
of 400 milligrams is what the studies

01:41:49.730 --> 01:41:52.190
that I was able to find show or used.

01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:56.560
The effects on cognitive decline
are described as notable.

01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:59.580
Notable, meaning several
studies showed a significant

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:04.425
but modest effect on in
offsetting cognitive decline,

01:42:04.425 --> 01:42:06.580
in particular in older populations

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:09.610
and some populations,
even with some reported

01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:11.320
neuro degeneration.

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.730
Power output was notable.

01:42:13.730 --> 01:42:15.853
How notable, what does that mean, notable?

01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:20.743
A study noted a 14%
increase in power output.

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.315
That's pretty substantial, 14%.

01:42:25.315 --> 01:42:26.810
And if you think about it,
but it wasn't like a doubling

01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:28.020
or something of that sort.

01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:29.890
Believe it or not, the
symptoms of Alzheimer's

01:42:29.890 --> 01:42:33.640
have been shown at least
among the nutraceuticals

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:37.210
of which alpha GPC is to
significantly improve cognition

01:42:37.210 --> 01:42:38.060
in people with Alzheimer's.

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:40.020
Now this episode, isn't
about cognitive decline

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.990
and longevity, we will talk about that,

01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:46.990
but this is a so-called
another effect of alpha GPC.

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:51.080
Fat oxidation is increased by alpha GPC,

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:55.990
growth hormone release
is promoted by alpha GPC

01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:57.090
although to a small degree.

01:42:57.090 --> 01:43:01.900
So as you can see, things
like alpha GPC in particular

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.600
when they are combined
with low levels of caffeine

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:07.240
can have these effects of
improving power output,

01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:09.300
can improve growth hormone release,

01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:10.770
can improve fat oxidation.

01:43:10.770 --> 01:43:14.890
All these things in theory
can support skill learning.

01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:17.080
But what they're really
doing is they're adjusting

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.810
the foundation upon which
you are going to execute

01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:22.060
these many, many repetitions.

01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:24.640
The same thing would be
said for caffeine itself.

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.220
If that's something that motivates you

01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:27.720
and gets you out of a chair to actually do

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:30.040
the physical training,
then that's something

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.030
that can perhaps improve or enhance

01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:34.270
the rate of skill learning

01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:36.830
and how well you retain those skills.

01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:40.017
Now on a previous episode I talked about,

01:43:40.017 --> 01:43:43.910
and this was the episode on
epinephrin on adrenaline.

01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:47.600
I talked about how for mental,
for cognitive learning,

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:50.880
it makes sense to spike epinephrin,

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:55.190
to bump epinephrin levels
up adrenaline levels up

01:43:55.190 --> 01:43:57.060
after cognitive learning.

01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:59.930
For physical learning, it
appears to be the opposite

01:43:59.930 --> 01:44:02.690
that if caffeine is in your practice

01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:05.240
or if you decide to try alpha GPC

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.450
that you would want to do
that before the training,

01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:09.333
take it before the training use it.

01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:11.640
Its effect should extend
into the training,

01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:14.290
presumably throughout, and then afterward

01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:16.320
if you're thinking about
following some of the protocols

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.950
that we discussed today,
that you would use

01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:21.690
some sort of idle time
where the brain can replay

01:44:21.690 --> 01:44:23.590
these motor sequences in reverse.

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:25.401
And then of course, you want to do things

01:44:25.401 --> 01:44:26.400
that optimize your sleep.

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.490
A lot of the questions I
get are about how different

01:44:29.490 --> 01:44:31.150
protocols and things that I described

01:44:31.150 --> 01:44:32.740
start to collide with one another.

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:35.410
So let's say for instance,
you go to bed at 10:30

01:44:35.410 --> 01:44:39.810
and you're going to do your
skill training at 9:30,

01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:42.610
well, taking a lot of caffeine
then is not going to be

01:44:42.610 --> 01:44:44.700
a good idea 'cause it's going
to compromise your sleep.

01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:48.270
So I'm not here to design
the perfect schedule for you

01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:50.450
because everyone's situation's vary.

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:55.450
So the things to optimize
are repetitions, failures,

01:44:55.670 --> 01:45:00.350
more repetitions, more failures
at the offset of training.

01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:02.950
Having some idle time that
can be straight into sleep

01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:06.420
or it could be simply letting
the brain just go idle

01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:09.380
for five to 10 minutes, mean
not focusing on anything,

01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:11.870
not scrolling, social media, not emailing,

01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:14.530
not ideally not even talking
to somebody just lying down

01:45:14.530 --> 01:45:16.300
or sitting quietly with your eyes closed

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:18.820
letting those motor sequences replay.

01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:21.900
Then we talked about how one can come back

01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:23.760
for additional training sessions,

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.130
use things like metronoming
where you're queuing

01:45:26.130 --> 01:45:30.070
your attention to some
external cue, some stimulus,

01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:32.420
in this case, an auditory
stimulus most likely

01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:34.760
and trying to generate more
repetitions per unit time.

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:37.373
So again, it's repetitions
and errors, that's key.

01:45:38.650 --> 01:45:40.120
And then we also talked about some things

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:42.800
that you can do involving
cerebellar neurophysiology

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:45.970
to extend range of motion if
that's what's limiting for you

01:45:45.970 --> 01:45:49.880
or to use visualization
to augment the practice

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:53.740
or let's say your particular
skill involves nice weather

01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:55.330
and it's raining or snowing outside

01:45:55.330 --> 01:45:57.270
and you can't get outside or thunderstorm,

01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:59.190
then that's where visualization training

01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:02.020
might be a good replacement
under those conditions.

01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:04.510
Or in most cases is going
to be the kind of thing

01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:05.440
that you're going to want to do

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:08.130
in addition to the actual physical skill

01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:10.890
or strength training session done,

01:46:10.890 --> 01:46:12.420
at least in the study that we described

01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:16.240
for 15 minutes a day, five days a week

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:19.250
over a period of 10 to 12 weeks or so.

01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:20.830
So hopefully that makes it clear.

01:46:20.830 --> 01:46:23.370
Today we've covered a lot of mechanism.

01:46:23.370 --> 01:46:26.270
We talked so much about the
different motor pathway,

01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:27.500
central pattern generator.

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:31.580
So you now are armed
with a lot of information

01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:33.400
about how you generate movement.

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.760
And I like to think that you're also armed

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:38.930
with a lot of information
about how to design protocols

01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:41.363
that are optimized for
you or if you're a coach,

01:46:43.966 --> 01:46:46.170
for your trainees in order to optimize

01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:49.430
their learning of skills various kinds.

01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:53.090
Today we focused almost
entirely on motor skills,

01:46:53.090 --> 01:46:55.740
things like musical
skills or physical skills.

01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:58.880
These have some overlap,
they're partially overlapping

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.080
with neuroplasticity, for
learning things like languages

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.193
or math or engineering or
neuroscience for that matter.

01:47:06.610 --> 01:47:09.530
Before we depart, I just want to make sure

01:47:09.530 --> 01:47:13.360
that I return to a concept,
which is the ultradian cycle.

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.510
Ultradian cycles are
these 90 minute cycles

01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:17.240
that we go through throughout
sleep and wakefulness

01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:19.950
that are optimal for
learning and attention.

01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:24.890
In the waking state, they
are the stages of sleep

01:47:26.006 --> 01:47:26.839
in which we have either
predominantly slowey sleep

01:47:26.839 --> 01:47:27.940
or rem sleep.

01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:29.800
Some of you who have been
following this podcast

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:32.950
for a while might be asking,
well should a physical practice

01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:35.330
be 90 minutes.

01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:38.160
That's going to depend because
with physical practices,

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.370
oftentimes for instance,
with strength training,

01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:41.510
that might be too long.

01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:44.020
You're not going to be able to
generate enough force output

01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:45.470
for it to be worthwhile.

01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:46.670
For golfing, I don't know.

01:47:46.670 --> 01:47:48.530
I've never played golf with
all my friends that play golf,

01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:50.640
they disappear onto the
golf course for many hours.

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:53.710
So I know there's a lot
of walking and driving

01:47:53.710 --> 01:47:55.770
and other stuff, I even hear that somebody

01:47:55.770 --> 01:48:00.130
carries your stuff around for
you sometimes, not always.

01:48:00.130 --> 01:48:02.750
But it's going to differ.

01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:05.320
A four hour golf game,
you're probably not swinging

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.600
the golf club for four hours,
so it's going to depend.

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:12.020
I would say that the ultradian
cycle is not necessarily

01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:15.510
a good constraint for skill
learning in most cases.

01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:17.950
And I should say that for
those of you that are short

01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:20.350
on time or have limited amounts of time,

01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:22.190
10 minutes of maximum repetitions,

01:48:22.190 --> 01:48:24.520
maximum focus skill learning work is going

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.800
to be very beneficial.

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:29.850
Whereas two hours of kind of haphazard

01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:33.560
not really focused work or
where you're not generating

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.340
very many repetitions 'cause you're doing

01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:37.390
few repetitions then you're
texting on your phone

01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:38.550
or pay attention to something else,

01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:40.180
that's not going to be beneficial.

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.350
It's really about the density of training

01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:43.230
inside of a session.

01:48:43.230 --> 01:48:45.300
So I think you should let the...

01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:47.960
Work toward maximal or
near maximum density

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:51.010
of repetitions and failures
provided they're failures

01:48:51.010 --> 01:48:54.590
you can perform safely in order
to accelerate skill learning

01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:57.520
and don't let some
arbitrary or in this case,

01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:00.040
the ultradian constraint prevent you

01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:01.370
from engaging in that practice.

01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:03.530
In other words, get the work
in, get as much work done

01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:05.220
as you can per unit time.

01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.240
And based on the science,
based on things that I've seen,

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.300
based on things that I'm now involved in

01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:14.420
with various communities, you
will see the skill improve

01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:16.610
vastly at various stages.

01:49:16.610 --> 01:49:18.170
Sometimes it's a little bit stutter start,

01:49:18.170 --> 01:49:20.810
it's not always a linear improvement

01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:23.600
but you will see incredible
improvement in skill.

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.050

There, you can support us
at any level that you like.

01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:25.690
In previous episodes and in this episode,

01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:27.330
I mentioned some supplements.

01:50:27.330 --> 01:50:31.280
Supplements certainly have
their place for various things.

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:33.810
They aren't necessary, but
many people, including myself

01:50:33.810 --> 01:50:35.650
derive benefit from supplements

01:50:35.650 --> 01:50:38.700
for things like improving sleep
and immune system function

01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:40.570
and learning and so forth.

01:50:40.570 --> 01:50:42.770
If you're interested in seeing
the supplements that I take,

01:50:42.770 --> 01:50:46.140
you can go to thorne.com/u,

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:48.500
that's the letter U slash Huberman

01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:50.740
and you can see the
supplements that I take.

01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:53.102
If you want to try any
of those supplements,

01:50:53.102 --> 01:50:56.700
you can get 20% off simply by
accessing the Thorne webpage

01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:59.090
through that portal, as well as 20% off

01:50:59.090 --> 01:51:01.560
any of the other supplements
that Thorne makes.

01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:03.060
The reason we've partnered with Thorne

01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:05.920
is because Thorne has the very
highest levels of stringency

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:08.580
in terms of the quality of the supplements

01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:11.690
and the accuracy about the
amounts of each supplement

01:51:11.690 --> 01:51:12.523
that are in the bottle.

01:51:12.523 --> 01:51:15.000
One of the major problems
in the supplement industry

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.070
is that when supplements get tested,

01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:21.120
often it's the case that the
amount of a given ingredient

01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:24.660
is far lower or far greater
than what's reported

01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:25.493
on the bottle.

01:51:25.493 --> 01:51:26.840
That's not the case for Thorne.

01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:29.790
Thorne has very high levels of stringency,

01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:31.320
they partnered with the Mayo Clinic

01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.770
and all the major sports teams

01:51:32.770 --> 01:51:34.750
and that's why we partnered
with them as well.

01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:36.230
So if you want to check those out again,

01:51:36.230 --> 01:51:41.220
it's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E
slash the letter U/Huberman

01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:45.150
to get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes.

01:51:45.150 --> 01:51:47.060
And last but not least,
I want to thank you

01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.640
for your time and attention.

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:51.240
I very much appreciate your
interest in neuroscience

01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:54.180
and in physiology and in
tools that are informed

01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:56.200
by neuroscience and physiology.

01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:58.850
Today, we talked all about skill learning.

01:51:58.850 --> 01:52:01.000
I hope that you'll
consider the information,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.810
you might even decide to
try some of these tools.

01:52:02.810 --> 01:52:05.430
If you do, please let us
know your results with them.

01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:07.120
Give us feedback in the comments

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:10.313
and as always, thank you for
your interest in science.
