00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.350
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.670
where we discuss science

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.859
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.442
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.780
My name is Andrew Huberman

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.550
and I'm a professor of Neurobiology

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.890
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford school of medicine.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.170
This podcast is separate

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.500
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.250
It is however, part of my desire

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.910
and effort to bring zero
cost to consumer information

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.970
about science and science related tools

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.810
to the general public.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.420
In keeping with that theme.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.450
I want to thank the first
sponsor of today's podcast.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.980
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.890
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.820
that analyzes blood factors
and DNA related factors

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.250
that helps you develop a
personalized health plan.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.430
Many important factors
related to our health

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.710
and wellbeing can only be measured

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.780
by a blood sample and by a DNA sample.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.640
I've been getting my blood
work done for many years now.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.090
And I use InsideTracker

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.800
because InsideTracker makes it very easy

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.900
to not only get the blood work done,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.180
someone can come to your house

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.450
or you can go to a clinic for instance

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.150
but also to interpret
the data that you get.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.300
Oftentimes when we get blood work done

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.020
there are all these numbers
and all these levels

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.570
of different hormones and
metabolic factors and so forth.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.504
But one doesn't know what
to do with that information

00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:20.320
InsideTracker has a
terrific dashboard platform

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.780
where you go online and it
makes analyzing all that easy.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.910
And it also provides some very simple

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.490
and straightforward directives

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.300
in terms of exercise, nutrition

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.080
and other lifestyle factors
that can help guide your health

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.720
and improve your health.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.510
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.910
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.840
and use the code "Huberman" at checkout

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.750
to get 25% off your order.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.680
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.210
Headspace is a meditation app
that makes meditating easy.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.510
I've been meditating on and off
for about three decades now.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.150
And typically it's been more off than on.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.260
I think like a lot of people

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.300
I find it hard to stick
with a meditation practice.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.080
A few years ago, I started
using the Headspace app.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.040
And when I did that,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550
I found that I was meditating
really consistently.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.180
First of all, the meditations
in Headspace are backed

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.870
by quality scientific
peer reviewed studies.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.130
Second of all the meditations
allow the meditation

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.120
to be kind of easy and fun to access.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.380
I started first using
them when I would travel

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.760
because on JetBlue flights,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.560
which was the airline I was using

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.680
the meditations are
offered as an alternative

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.740
to watching a TV or a movie.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.930
And I found that I would arrive
feeling much more refreshed

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.420
than had I just sort of zoned
out on the TV the whole time,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.410
or even if I had slept.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.960
And I'll continue to
use Headspace regularly

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.280
pretty much every day
for a short meditation.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.330
And I personally derive
tremendous benefits from it.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.160
If you'd like to try Headspace

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.630
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.560
and they'll give you one
month of all the meditations

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.420
that they have available completely free.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.160
That's the best offer available
right now from Headspace.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.040
So you can go to
headspace.com/specialoffer

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.140
and you'll get one month completely free

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.290
all the meditations they have.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.056
The third sponsor of
today's podcast is Madefor.

00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:09.300
Madefor as a behavioral science company

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.100
that is a subscription model

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.810
in which you engage in
specific activities each month

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.760
for 10 months in order to bring about

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.880
positive behavioral
change and growth mindset.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.060
The company was founded by
former Navy seal Patrick Dossett

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.640
as well as Toms founder Blake Mycoskie.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.920
I'm the lead advisor of the
scientific advisory board

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.630
at Madefor and some of the other members

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.940
of the advisory board include

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.440
the head of the chronobiology unit

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.250
at the national institute of health

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.740
as well as psychiatrists
from Harvard, UC Irvine

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.700
and many other individuals
who are serious about science

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.400
and helped develop the Madefor program.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.210
If you want to try Madefor,
you can go to getmadefor.com

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.290
and if you enter "Huberman" at checkout

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.393
you'll get 15% off the program.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.860
Today we're talking about neuroplasticity

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.220
which is this incredible
feature of our nervous systems

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.910
that allows it to change
in response to experience.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.840
neuroplasticity is arguably

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.150
one of the most important
aspects of our biology.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.710
It holds the promise
for each and all of us

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.330
to think differently, to learn new things,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.840
to forget painful experiences

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.530
and to essentially adapt to
anything that life brings us

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.723
by becoming better.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.570
Neuroplasticity has a
long and important history

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.150
and we're not going to
review all of it in detail.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
But today what we are
going to do is discuss

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.380
what is neuroplasticity?

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.530
As well as the different
forms of neuroplasticity.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.110
We're going to talk about
how to access neuroplasticity

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.610
depending on how old you are

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.540
and depending on the
specific types of changes

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.600
that you're trying to create.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.880
This is a topic for which
there are lots of tools,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.320
as well as lots of biological principles

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.840
that we can discuss.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.690
So let's get started.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.880
Most people are familiar with
the word neuroplasticity.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.030
It's sometimes also
called neural plasticity.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.590
Those are the same thing.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.350
So, if I say neuroplasticity
or neural plasticity,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.440
I'm referring to the same process,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.970
which is the brain and
nervous system's ability

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.500
to change itself.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.740
There are a lot of reasons

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.750
why the nervous system would do this.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.900
It could do it in response
to some traumatic event.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.710
It could, for instance,
create a sense of fear

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.080
around a particular place

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.640
or a fear of automobiles or planes.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.680
It could also occur when
something positive happens,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.830
like the birth of our first child

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.660
or when our puppy does something amusing

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.453
or we see an incredible feat
of performance in athleticism.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.490
The word neuroplasticity

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.373
means so many things to
so many different people

00:05:45.373 --> 00:05:46.750
that I thought it would be important

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.870
to just first put a little
bit of organizational logic

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.340
around what it is and how it happens,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.460
because nowadays if you were to go online

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.850
and Google the word neuroplasticity,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.470
you would find hundreds of
thousands of references,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.940
scientific references

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.740
as well as a lot of falsehoods
about what neuroplasticity is

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.460
and how to access it.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.330
As I mentioned before,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.860
we're going to talk
about the science of it

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.080
and we're going to talk about the tools

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.500
that allow you to engage

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.930
this incredible feature
of your nervous system.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.080
And that's the first point,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.280
which is that all of us were
born with a nervous system

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.460
that isn't just capable of change,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.490
but was designed to change.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.053
When we enter the world,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.660
our nervous system is primed for learning.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.780
The brain and nervous system of a baby

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.160
is wired very crudely.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.400
The connections are not precise.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.200
And we can see evidence of that

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.780
in the fact that babies
are kind of flopping,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.230
they're like a little
potato bug with limbs.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.220
They can't really do much in
terms of coordinated movement.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.260
They certainly can't speak

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.530
and they can't really do
anything with precision.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.980
And that's because we come
into this world overconnected.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.420
We have essentially wires,

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.840
those wires have names
like axons and dendrites.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.350
Those are the different
parts of the neurons

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.840
discussed in episode one,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.550
but those little parts and
those wires and connections

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.090
are everywhere.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.070
Imagine a bunch of roads

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.140
that are all connected to one
another in kind of a mess,

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.900
but there are no highways.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.110
They're all just small roads.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.780
That's essentially what the
young nervous system is like.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.570
And then as we mature, as
we go from day one of life

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.920
to 10 years old, 20
years old, 30 years old,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.130
what happens is

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.350
particular connections get
reinforced and stronger

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.540
and other connections are lost.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.150
So that's the first important principle

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.220
that I want everyone to understand,

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.990
which is that developmental plasticity,

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.800
the neuroplasticity that
occurs from the time we're born

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.030
until about age 25 is mainly a process

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.360
of removing connections that
don't serve our goals well.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.180
Now, of course, certain events happen

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.410
during that birth to 25 period

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.450
in which positive events
and negative events

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.860
are really stamped down
into our nervous system

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.510
in a very dramatic fashion,

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.440
by what we call one-trial learning.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.880
We experience something once

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.440
and then our nervous
system is forever changed

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.500
by that experience.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.560
Unless of course, we go through some work

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.320
to undo that experience.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.550
So, I want you to imagine in your mind

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.540
that when you were
brought into this world,

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.530
you were essentially a widely
connected web of connections

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.390
that was really poor
at doing any one thing.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.050
And that through your experience,

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:34.930
what you were exposed to by your parents

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.270
or rather caretakers,

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.250
through your social interactions,
through your thoughts,

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.970
through the languages that you learn,

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.200
through the places you
traveled or didn't travel,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.510
your nervous system became customized

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.930
to your unique experience.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.540
Now, that's true for
certain parts of your brain

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.790
that are involved in what we call

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.330
representations of the outside world.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.360
A lot of your brain

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.190
is designed to represent the visual world

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.610
or represent the auditory world

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.330
or represent the gallery of smells

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.020
that are possible in the world.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.480
However, there are aspects
of your nervous system

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.610
that were designed not to be plastic.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.570
They were wired so that plasticity

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.200
or changes in those
circuits is very unlikely.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.260
Those circuits include things like,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.170
the ones that control your heartbeat,

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.040
the ones that control your breathing,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.790
the ones that control your digestion,

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.670
And thank goodness that those
circuits were set up that way

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.510
because you want those circuits
to be extremely reliable.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.000
You never want to have to think about

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.340
whether or not your heart will beat

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.970
or whether or not you
will continue breathing

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.730
or whether or not you'll be
able to digest your food.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.800
So many nervous system
features like digestion

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.653
and breathing and heart
rate are hard to change.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.080
Other aspects of our nervous system

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.780
are actually quite easy to change.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.760
And one of the great gifts of childhood,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.600
adolescence and young adulthood,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.020
is that we can learn through
almost passive experience.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.770
We don't have to focus that hard

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.420
in order to learn new things.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.720
In fact, children go
from being able to speak

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.270
no language whatsoever

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.420
to being able to speak many many words

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.700
and comprise sentences

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.750
including words they've never heard before

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.750
which is remarkable.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.610
It means that

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.210
the portions of the brain
involved in speech and language

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.623
are actually primed to learn
and create new combinations.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.860
What this tells us is that the young brain

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.040
is a plasticity machine.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.550
But then right about age 25
plus or minus a year or two,

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.290
everything changes.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.350
After age 25 or so,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.830
in order to get changes
in our nervous system,

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.560
we have to engage in a completely
different set of processes

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.460
in order to get those changes to occur

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.660
and for them more
importantly to stick around.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.170
And this is something that
I think is vastly overlooked

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.580
in the popular culture
discussion about neuroplasticity.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.710
People always talk about
fire together, wire together.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.370
Fire together wire together is true.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.330
It is the statement of
my colleague at Stanford,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.260
Carla Shatz

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.830
and it's an absolute truth

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.880
about the way that the
nervous system wires up

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.550
early in development.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.360
But, fire together wire together

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.380
doesn't apply in the
same way after age 25.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.070
And so we have these little
memes and these little quotes

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.180
that, you know circulate on the internet

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.830
like fire together, wire together

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.010
or there's a famous quote

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:24.080
from the greatest neurobiologist
of all time, Ramón y Cajal.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.410
I think it goes something like, you know

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.730
should somebody wish to
change their nervous system

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.140
they could be the sculptor
of their nervous system

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.320
in any way they want, something like that.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.310
And that sounds great.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.270
I mean, who wouldn't want to
change their nervous system

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.370
any way they want,

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.820
but what's lost in those statements

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.960
is how to actually accomplish that.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.700
And we're going to cover that today

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.290
but please understand
that early in development

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.370
your nervous system is
connected very broadly

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.120
in ways that make it very
hard to do anything well.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.960
From birth until about age 25

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.910
those connections get refined

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.360
mainly through the removal

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.030
of connections that don't serve us

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.050
and the incredible
strengthening of connections

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.060
that relate to either powerful experiences

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.240
or that allow us to do
things like walk and talk

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.520
and do math, et cetera.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.680
And then after age 25,

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.540
if we want to change those connections,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.640
those super highways of connectivity,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.710
we have to engage in some
very specific processes.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.190
And those processes, as
we'll soon learn are gated.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.340
Meaning you can't just
decide to change your brain.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.340
You actually have to go
through a series of steps

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.450
to change your internal state

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.300
in ways that will allow
you to change your brain.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.870
I just want to acknowledge that

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.500
Costello is snoring
particularly loud today.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.760
Some of you seem very keen
at picking up on his snoring,

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.010
others of you can't hear his snoring.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.010
It's very low rumbling sound

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.690
and whether or not you can or you can't

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.780
probably relates to the
sensitivity of your hearing.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.980
We're actually going to talk
about perfect pitch today

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.270
and range of auditory detection.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.390
And so if you can hear
Costello's snoring enjoy,

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.223
if you can't, enjoy.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.870
I want to talk about how
the nervous system changes.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.160
What are these changes?

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.960
Many of us have been captivated

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.880
by the stories in the popular press

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.670
about the addition of new neurons.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.050
This idea, oh, if you go
running or you exercise,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.460
your brain actually makes new neurons.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.530
Well, I'm going to give you the
bad news first which is that,

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.090
after puberty, so after
about age 14 or 15,

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.490
the human brain and nervous
system adds very few

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.030
if any new neurons.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.260
The idea that new neurons
could be added to the brain

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.520
is one that has a rich history
in experimental science.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.410
It's clear that in rodents
and in some non-human primates

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.850
new neurons, a process
called neurogenesis,

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:48.000
can occur in areas of the brain,
such as the olfactory bulb,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.010
which is of course involved in smell

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.890
as well as a region of our hippocampus,

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.250
a center of the brain involved in memory

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.070
called the dentate gyrus
of the hippocampus.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.780
And there is strong evidence

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.180
that new neurons can be
added to those structures

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.000
throughout the lifespan.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.430
In humans, the evidence is a
little bit more controversial.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.490
It's clear that we can add new neurons

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.340
to our olfactory bulb.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.170
In fact, if any of you have ever

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.150
had the unfortunate experience

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.460
of being hit on the head too hard,

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.160
the wires called axons from
those olfactory neurons

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.490
that live in your nose

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.580
can get sheared off

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.220
because they have to
pass through a bony plate

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.250
called the cribriform plate.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.620
And the cribriform plate
can shear those axons

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.140
and people can become
what's called anosmic,

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.950
they won't be able to smell.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.490
But over time, those neurons

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.020
unlike most all central
nervous system neurons

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.440
can grow those connections back

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.350
and even reestablish new neurons

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.300
being added to the olfactory bulb.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.000
They come from elsewhere deep in the brain

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.500
and they migrate through a pathway called

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.930
the rostral migratory stream.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.100
You can Google these words

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.140
and look up some of the
descriptions of this

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.530
if you'd like to learn more.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.670
So indeed there is some evidence

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.810
that the neurons responsible for smell

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.690
can be replaced throughout the lifespan.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.880
Certainly, in very young individuals

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.253
from birth till about age 15 or so.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.180
Whether or not they're new
neurons added to the hippocampus,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.740
the memory center of the
human brain isn't clear.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.010
Many years ago, Rusty Gage's
lab at the Salk Institute

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.540
did a really important study

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.390
looking at terminally ill cancer patients

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.370
and injecting them with a label,

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.000
a dye that is incorporated
only into new neurons.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.510
And after these patients died,
their brains were harvested.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.330
The brains were looked at and
there were new neurons there,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.530
there was evidence for new neurons.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.560
Those results I think stand over time

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.520
but what was not really discussed

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.250
in the popular press
discussion around those papers

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.760
was that it was very few
cells that were being added.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.790
And a number of papers have
come along over the years

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.490
mainly from labs at UCSF,
although from others as well,

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.580
showing that if there are new neurons

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.430
added to the adult brain,

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.740
it's an infinitesimally
small number of new neurons.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.880
So that's the depressing part,
we don't get new neurons.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.160
After we're born, we pretty
much have the neurons

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.440
that we're going to use our entire life.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.900
And yes, as we get older

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.480
and we start to lose certain
functions in our brain,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.020
we lose neurons.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.410
But all is not lost, so to speak,

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.900
because there are other
ways in which neurocircuits

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.910
can create new connections
and add new functions

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.200
including new memory, new abilities

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.363
and new cognitive functions.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.620
And those are mainly through the process

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.750
of making certain connections,

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.540
which of course are those
things we call synapses,

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.320
between neurons making
those connections stronger.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.540
So they're more reliable,

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.620
they're more likely to engage

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.910
as well as removing connections.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.030
And the removal of connections is vital

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.640
to say moving through a grieving process

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.220
or removing the emotional load
of a traumatic experience.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.370
So even though we can't add new neurons

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.070
throughout our lifespan,

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.210
at least not in very great numbers,

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.610
it's clear that we can
change our nervous system,

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.610
that the nervous system
is available for change,

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:07.320
that if we create the
right set of circumstances

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.840
in our brain, chemical circumstances,

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.260
and if we create the right

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.940
environmental circumstances around us,

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.400
our nervous system will
shift into a mode in which

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.120
change isn't just possible
but it's probable.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.770
As I mentioned before,

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.110
the hallmark of the child
nervous system is change,

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.920
it wants to change.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.880
The whole thing,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.210
everything from the chemicals

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.670
that are sloshing around in there

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.220
to the fact that there's a lot
of space between the neurons.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.860
A lot of people don't know
this, but early in development

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.247
there's a lot of space
between the neurons.

00:17:37.247 --> 00:17:39.270
And so the neurons can
literally move around

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.340
and sample different
connections very easily

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.190
removing some and keeping others.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.550
As we get older, the
so-called extracellular space

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.330
is actually filled up

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.780
by things called extracellular
matrix and glial cells.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.770
Glial means glue.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.040
Those cells are involved in a
bunch of different processes

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.190
but they start to fill in all the space

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.610
kind of like pouring
concrete between rocks.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.580
And when that happens,
it becomes much harder

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.120
to change the connections that are there.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.590
One of the ways in which
we can all get plasticity

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.870
at any stage throughout the lifespan

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.820
is through deficits and impairments

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.070
in what we call our sensory apparati,

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.500
our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.170
and there are some very dramatic

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.760
and somewhat tragic examples of people,

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.600
for instance who have genetic mutations

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.760
where they're born without a nose

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.170
and without any olfactory
structures in the brain

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.340
so they cannot smell.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.940
In that case areas of the brain

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.000
that normally would represent smell

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.300
become overtaken by areas of the brain

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.250
involved in other things like
touch and hearing and sight.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.650
In individuals that are blind from birth,

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.410
the so-called occipital cortex,

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.160
the visual cortex in the back,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.000
becomes overtaken by hearing.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.680
The neurons there will
start to respond to sounds

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.020
as well as braille touch.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.920
And actually there's a one
particularly tragic incident

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.160
where a woman who was blind since birth

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.710
and because of neuroimaging studies,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.540
we knew her visual cortex
was no longer visual,

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.870
it was responsible for braille
reading and for hearing,

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.910
she had a stroke that actually took out

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.190
most of the function of her visual cortex.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.220
So then she was blind, she
couldn't braille read or hear.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.650
She did recover some aspect of function.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.210
Now, most people they don't end up in that

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.990
highly unfortunate situation.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.280
And what we know is that for instance,

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.800
blind people who use their visual cortex

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.880
for braille reading and for hearing,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.380
have much better auditory
acuity and touch acuity.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.400
Meaning they can sense
things with their fingers

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.180
and they can sense
things with their hearing

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.440
that typical sighted
folks wouldn't be able to.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.660
In fact, you will find a much greater

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.350
incidence of perfect pitch
in people that are blind.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.400
And that tells us that the brain

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.600
and in particular this
area we call the neocortex,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.940
which is the outer part,

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.830
is really designed to be a map

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.050
of our own individual experience.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:04.130
So these, what I call
experiments of impairment or loss

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.960
where somebody is blind from
birth or deaf from birth

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.960
or maybe has a limb development impairment

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.475
where they have a stump
instead of an entire limb

00:20:14.475 --> 00:20:16.400
with a functioning hand,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.100
their brain will represent
the body plan that they have,

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.100
not some other body plan.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.200
But the beauty of the situation is that

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.030
the real estate up in the
skull, that neocortex,

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:33.320
the essence of it is to be a
customized map of experience.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.380
Now, it is true however,

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.037
that if let's say I were
to be blind when I'm 50,

00:20:40.037 --> 00:20:42.363
I'm 45 right now, I've
always been sighted.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:44.930
If I was blind at 50,

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.460
I'll probably have less opportunity

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.610
to use my formerly visual cortex

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.730
for things like braille
reading and hearing

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.160
because my brain has changed,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.840
it's just not the same brain
I had when I was a baby.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.070
So there's actually a
principle of biology,

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.180
not many people know this,

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.190
it's actually a principle neurology

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.180
which is called the Kennard principle,

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.020
which says, if you're going
to have a brain injury,

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.797
you want to have it early in life.

00:21:09.797 --> 00:21:12.270
And of course better to not
have a brain injury at all

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.360
but if you're going to have it

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.860
you want to have it early in life.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.640
And this is based on a
tremendous number of experiments

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.420
examining the amount of recovery

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.840
and the rate of recovery in humans

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.540
that had lesions to their brain

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.380
either early in life or later in life.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.570
So the Kennard Principle says

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.850
better to have injuries early in life.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.110
Now, that's reassuring
for the young folks,

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.440
it's not so reassuring
for the older folks.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.823
But there are aspects of neuroplasticity

00:21:36.823 --> 00:21:38.690
that have nothing to do with impairments.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.290
I mean earlier I said

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.640
we're all walking around with this map,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.810
this representation of the world around us

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.640
so we can see edges, we can see colors,

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.730
except for folks that are
color blind of course,

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.640
and we also have a map
of emotional experience.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.920
We have a map of whether or not

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.600
certain people are trustworthy,

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.650
certain people aren't trustworthy.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.890
A few years ago I was at a course

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.440
and a woman came up to me and she said,

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.150
you know, I wasn't teaching
the course, I was in the course

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.490
and she said, "I just have to tell you

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:11.830
that every time you speak,
it really stresses me out."

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.030
And I said, "Well I've heard that before

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.180
but do you want to be more specific?"

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.850
And she said, "Yeah, your tone of voice

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:18.830
reminds me of somebody

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.810
that I had a really
terrible experience with."

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.490
I said, "Well, okay, well,
I can't change my voice

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.830
but I really appreciate
that you acknowledge that

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.956
and it also will help explain why

00:22:27.956 --> 00:22:30.420
you seem to cringe every time I speak",

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.640
which I hadn't noticed until then

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.420
but after that I did notice.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.570
She had a very immediate

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.240
and kind of visceral
response to my speech,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.420
perhaps some of you are
having that right now.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.500
But in any event, over the
period of this two-week course,

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.527
she would come back every
once in a while and say,

00:22:44.527 --> 00:22:46.700
"You know what I think,
just by telling you

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.740
that your voice was really
difficult for me to listen to,

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.750
it's actually becoming
more tolerable to me."

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.600
And by the end we actually
became pretty good friends

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.600
and we're still in touch.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.150
And so what this says is that
the recognition of something

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.760
whether or not that's an emotional thing

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.880
or a desire to learn something else

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.630
is actually the first
step in neuroplasticity.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:06.900
And that's because

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.030
our nervous system has two
broad sets of functions.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.440
Some of those functions are reflexive.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.880
Things like our breathing, our
heart rate, our obvious ones,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.430
but other aspects are reflexive
like our ability to walk.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.600
If I get up out of this chair
and walk out of the door,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.390
I don't think about each
step that I'm taking

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.010
and that's because I learned
how to walk during development.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.160
But when we decide that
we're going to shift

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.250
some sort of behavior or some reaction

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.670
or some new piece of information
that we want to learn,

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.180
it's something that we want to
bring into our consciousness,

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.140
that awareness is a remarkable thing

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.810
because it cues the brain

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.530
and the rest of the nervous system

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.990
that when we engage in
those reflexive actions

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.130
going forward,

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.640
that those reflexive actions

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.030
are no longer fated to be reflexive.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.390
Now if this sounds a little bit abstract,

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.640
we're going to talk about
protocols for how to do this.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.010
But the first step in neuroplasticity

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.610
is recognizing that you
want to change something

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.330
and you should immediately say, well,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.190
kids don't go into school and say,

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.700
oh, I want to learn language

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.370
or I want to learn social interactions,

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:09.880
and that's the beauty of childhood.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.330
The whole brain has this switch flipped

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.090
that is making change possible

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.650
but after that we have to be deliberate.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.750
We have to know what it is
exactly that we want to change.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.300
Or if we don't know exactly what it is

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.480
that we want to change,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.810
we at least have to know that
we want to change something

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.570
about some specific experience.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.120
In this case, I believe
that she came and told me

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.690
that my voice was really
awful for her to listen to

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.770
not to make me feel bad
or for any other reason

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:40.070
except that she wanted
it to not be the case.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.010
And she knew I wasn't
going to stop talking.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.580
So she decided to call
it to her consciousness

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.980
and mine as well.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.430
So that's important.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:48.680
If you want to learn something

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.410
or you want to change your
nervous system in any way,

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.500
whether or not it's
because of some impairment

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.510
or because of something
that you want to acquire,

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:00.510
a cognitive skill, a motor
skill, an emotional skill,

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.800
the first thing is recognizing
what that thing is.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.510
And that often can be the
hardest thing to identify

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.470
but the brain has the self
recognition mechanisms

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.690
and those self recognition mechanisms

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:16.350
are not vague, spiritual or mystical

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.570
or even psychological concepts.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.840
They are neurochemicals.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.360
We're going to talk next
about the neurochemicals

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.410
that stamp down particular behaviors

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.450
and thoughts and emotional patterns

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.540
and tell the rest of the nervous system,

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.790
this is something to pay attention to

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.780
because this is in the
direction of the change

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.910
that I want to make.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.610
So I'll repeat that, there
are specific chemicals

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.550
that when we are consciously aware

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.030
of a change we want to make

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.930
or even just that we
want to make some change,

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.130
chemicals are released in the brain

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.520
that allow us the opportunity
to make those changes.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.850
Now, there are specific protocols

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.630
that science tells us We have to follow

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.830
if we want those changes to occur.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:01.830
But that self-recognition is
not a kind of murky concept.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.460
What it is is it's our fore brain,

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.380
in particular our prefrontal cortex,

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.540
signaling the rest of our nervous system

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.290
that something that we're about to do,

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:15.360
hear, feel or experience is
worth paying attention to.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.580
So we'll pause there and then
I'm going to move forward.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.100
One of the biggest lies in the universe

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.290
that seems quite prominent right now

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:26.170
is that every experience
you have changes your brain.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.350
People love to say this.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.550
They love to say, your brain
is going to be different

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:30.430
after this lecture

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.890
or that your brain is going to
be different after today's class

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:33.880
than it was two days ago.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.240
And that's absolutely not true.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.490
The nervous system doesn't just change

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.660
because you experienced something

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.203
unless you're a very young child.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.920
The nervous system changes

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.880
when certain neurochemicals are released

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.890
and allow whatever neurons
are active in the period

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.900
in which those chemicals
are swimming around,

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.210
to strengthen or weaken the
connections of those neurons.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.970
Now, this is best illustrated

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.760
through a little bit
of scientific history.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.280
The whole basis of neuroplasticity

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.760
is essentially ascribed
to two individuals,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.960
although there were a lot more people

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.030
that were involved in this work.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.340
Those two individuals

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.970
go by the name David
Hubel and Torsten Wiesel.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.830
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel
started off at Johns Hopkins,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.710
moved to Harvard medical school.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.340
And in the seventies and eighties,

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.190
they did a series of experiments,

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.843
recording electrical
activity in the brain.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.890
They were in the visual cortex,

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.930
meaning they put the electrodes
in the visual cortex,

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.920
and they were exploring how vision works

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.570
and how the visual brain
organizes all the features

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.010
of the visual world to give us these

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.560
incredible things We
call visual perceptions.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.620
But Hubel was a physician.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.070
And he was very interested in what happens

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.160
when for instance, a
child comes into the world

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.690
and they have a cataract,

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:57.020
the lens of their eye,
isn't clear but it's opaque.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.450
Or when a kid has a lazy eye

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.300
or the eyes have what's called strabismus,

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.283
which is when the eyes either
deviate outward or inward.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.250
These are very common things of childhood,

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.240
especially in particular
areas of the world.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.260
And what David and Torsten
did is they figured out

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.070
that there was a critical period

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:20.110
in which if clear vision did not occur,

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:24.560
the visual brain would
completely rewire itself,

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.860
basically to represent

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.870
whatever bit of visual
information was coming in.

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.950
So they did these experiments

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.410
to kind of simulate a droopy
eye or a deviating eye

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:35.740
where they would close one eyelid

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.740
and then what they found
is that the visual brain

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.800
would respond entirely to the open eye.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.130
There was sort of a
takeover of the visual brain

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.203
representing the open eye.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.300
Many experiments in many
different sensory systems

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.200
followed up on this.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.640
There are beautiful
experiments for instance,

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.570
from Gregg Recanzone's lab up at UC Davis

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.060
and Mike Merzenich's lab at UCSF

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.460
showing that for instance

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.890
if two fingers were taped
together early in development,

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.610
so they weren't moving independently,

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.220
the representation of those two fingers

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.730
would become fused in the brain

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.700
so that the person couldn't
actually distinguish

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.050
the movements and the sensations

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:14.230
of the two fingers
separately, pretty remarkable.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:18.580
All of this is to say that
David and Torsten's work,

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.470
for which they won a noble prize,

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.120
they shared it with Rogers Barry,

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.460
their work showed that

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.480
the brain is in fact a customized
map of the outside world,

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.810
we said that already.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.270
But that what it's doing is it's measuring

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.840
the amount of activity for
a given part of our body,

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.090
one eye or the other, or our fingers,

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.260
this finger or that finger

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.840
and all of those inputs are competing

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.900
for space in the brain.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.830
Now this is fundamentally important

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.700
because what it means is that

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.060
if we are to change our
nervous system in adulthood,

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.810
we need to think about not
just what we're trying to get,

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.100
but what we're trying to give up.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.330
We can't actually add new connections

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.610
without removing something else.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.140
And that might seem like kind of a stinger

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.640
but it actually turns out
to be a great advantage.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:09.030
One of the key experiments
that David and Torsten did

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.760
was an experiment where
they closed both eyes,

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.870
where they essentially
removed all visual input

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.120
early in development.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.700
Now this is slightly
different than blindness

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.720
because it was transient,

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.620
it was only for a short period of time.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.530
But what they found is when they did that

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:23.790
there was no change.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.270
However, if they would close just one eye

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.060
there was a huge change.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.470
So when people tell you,

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.250
oh at the end of today's lecture,

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.630
or at the end of something

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.720
your brain is going to
be completely different,

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.810
that's simply not true.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.150
If you're older than 25

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.030
your brain will not change

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.620
unless there's a selective
shift in your attention

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.370
or a selective shift in your experience

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:49.130
that tells the brain it's time to change.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.860
And those changes occur

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.190
through the ways I talked about before

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.520
strengthening and weakening
of particular connections,

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.220
they have names like
long-term potentiation,

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.810
long-term depression,
which has nothing to do

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.370
with emotional depression by the way,

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:00.940
spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.410
I threw out those names
not to confuse you,

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.070
but for those of you that would like

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.340
more in-depth exploration of those,

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.690
please you can go google
those and look them up,

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.210
there are great Wikipedia pages for them

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.560
and you can go down the paper trail.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.230
I might even touch on them
on some subsequent episodes.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.610
But the important thing
to understand is that

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.640
if we want something to change,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.950
we really need to bring an
immense amount of attention

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.130
to whatever it is that we want to change.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.610
This is very much linked to
the statement I made earlier

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.640
about, it all starts with an awareness.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.150
Now, why is that attention important?

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.360
Well, David and Torsten
won their Nobel prize

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.250
and they certainly deserved it.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.110
They probably deserved two

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.740
because they also figured
out how vision works.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.910
And I might be biased

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:42.440
'cause they're my scientific
great-grandparents

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.420
but I think everybody in the
field of Neuroscience agrees

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.995
that Hubel and Wiesel, as they're called

00:31:48.995 --> 00:31:51.690
H&amp;W for those in the game,

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.190
absolutely deserved a
Nobel prize for their work

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.420
because they really unveiled
the mechanisms of brain change

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.090
of plasticity.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.410
David passed away a few years
ago, Torsten is still alive,

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.590
he's in his late 90s,

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.200
he's still at the Rockefeller university.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.320
He's sharp as a tack.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.460
He still jogs several miles a day.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.890
He's really into art and
a number of other things.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:11.120
He's also a super nice guy.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.660
Hubel was a really nice guy as well,

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.780
also he was a great
Frisbee player I discovered

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.790
'cause he beat me in a game of
ultimate when he was like 80,

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:20.120
which still, it has me a little bit irked.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.950
But anyway, Hubel and Wiesel

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.040
did an amazing thing for science

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.440
that will forever change

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.340
the way that we think about the brain.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.710
However, they were quite wrong

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.760
about this critical period thing.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.730
The critical period was this idea that

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.440
if you were to deprive the
nervous system of an input,

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.360
say closing one eye early in development

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.510
and the rest of the visual cortex is taken

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:45.800
over by the representation
of the open eye,

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.960
that you could never change that

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.920
unless you intervened early.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.340
And this actually formed the basis

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.190
for why a kid that has
a lazy eye or a cataract

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.890
why, even though there's some issues

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.120
with anesthesia in young children,

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.728
why now we know that you
want to get in there early

00:33:01.728 --> 00:33:05.430
and fix the cataract or fix the strabismus

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.660
it's what ophthalmologists do.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.030
However, their idea that
you had to do it early

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:14.150
or else there was no opportunity to rescue

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.640
the nervous system deficit later on

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.183
turned out wasn't entirely true.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.740
In the early 90s, a graduate student

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.150
by the name of Gregg Recanzone
was in the laboratory

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.980
of a guy named Mike Merzenich at UCSF.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.580
And they set out to test this idea

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.180
that if one wants to change their brain,

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.730
they need to do it early in life

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:37.140
because the adult brain
simply isn't plastic

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.610
it's not available for these changes.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:43.313
And they did a series of
absolutely beautiful experiments,

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.810
by now I think we can say proving

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.310
that the adult brain can change

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.860
provided certain conditions are met.

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.240
Now, the experiments they did are tough.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.500
They were tough on the experimenter

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.970
and they were tough on the subject.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.253
I'll just describe one.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.970
Let's say you were a subject
in one of their experiments.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:05.110
You would come into the lab
and you'd sit down at a table

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:09.490
and they would record
from or image your brain

00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:11.640
and look at the
representation of your fingers

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.770
the digits as we call them.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.450
And there would be a spinning drum,

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:20.180
literally a like a stone drum
in front of your metal drum

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.520
that had little bumps.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.530
Some of the bumps were
spaced close together,

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:25.400
some of them were spaced far apart.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.130
And they would do these experiments

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:31.530
where they would expect their
subjects to press a lever

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.000
whenever for instance, the
bumps got closer together

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.930
or further apart and these
were very subtle differences.

00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:39.780
So in order to do this you
really have to pay attention

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.720
to the distance between the bumps

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.310
and these were not braille readers

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.163
or anyone skilled in doing
these kinds of experiments.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.220
What they found was that as people paid

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.860
more and more attention to the
distance between these bumps

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.370
and they would signal
when there was a change

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.270
by pressing a lever,

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.960
as they did that there
was very rapid changes

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.240
plasticity in the
representation of the fingers.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.830
And it could go in either direction.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.430
You could get people very
good at detecting the distance

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.390
between bumps, that the
distance was getting smaller

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.730
or that the distance was getting greater.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.600
So people could get
very good at these tasks

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.950
that you're kind of hard to
imagine how they would translate

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.900
to the real world for
a non braille reader.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.250
But what it told us is
that these maps of touch

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.710
were very much available for plasticity.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.150
And these were fully adult subjects.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.150
They're not taking any specific drugs.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:30.720
They don't have any impairments
that we're aware of.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.770
And what it showed, what it proved

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.860
is that the adult brain is very plastic.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.020
And they did some beautiful
control experiments

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.090
that are important for
everyone to understand

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.730
which is that sometimes
they would bring people in

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.520
and they would have them touch these bumps

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.230
on this spinning drum but
they would have the person

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.030
pay attention to an auditory cue.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.480
Every time a tone would go off,

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.990
or there was a shift in
the pitch of that tone,

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.280
they would have to signal that.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.650
So the subject thought
they were doing something

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.520
related to touch and hearing
and all that showed was that

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.440
it wasn't just the mere action
of touching these bumps.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.720
They had to pay attention
to the bumps themselves.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.860
If they were placing their attention

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.920
on the auditory cue on the tone,

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.840
well then there was plasticity
in the auditory portion

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.230
of the brain but not on the
touch portion of the brain.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:17.900
And this really spits in
the face of this thing

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.680
that you hear so often
which is every experience

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.970
that you have is going to
change the way your brain works.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.090
Absolutely not.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:29.690
The experiences that you pay
super careful attention to

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.680
are what open up plasticity

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.100
and it opens up plasticity
to that specific experience.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.660
So the question then is why?

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.240
And Merzenich and his
graduate students and postdocs

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.600
went on to address this question of why.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.480
And it turns out the answer

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.550
is a very straightforward
neurochemical answer.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.140
And inside of that
answer is the opportunity

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.030
for any of us to change
our brain at any point

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.220
throughout our lifespan,

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.560
essentially for anything
that we want to learn,

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.390
that could be subtracting an emotion

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.110
from an experience we've had,

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.160
it could be building a
greater range of emotion,

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.450
it could be learning new information

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:09.030
like learning a new language.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:14.030
It could be learning new motor
skill, like dance or sport

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.820
or it could be some
combination of cognitive motor.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.470
So for instance, an air traffic
controller has to do a lot

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.850
with their mind in addition
to a lot with their hands.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:24.420
So it's not just cognitive,

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.430
it's not just motor but combined.

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.730
So we're going to talk
about what that chemical is

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:32.010
but to just give you an important hint,

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.720
that chemical is the
same chemical of stress.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.960
This is not a discussion
about stress per se.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.680
In a future podcast episode,
we'll talk all about stress

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.000
and tools to deal with stress,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.650
something my lab works
on quite extensively.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:48.350
And it's a topic that I enjoy discussing.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.800
But this is a topic about brain change.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.730
And what I just told you

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.310
is that in order to change the brain

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:55.190
you have to pay careful attention.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.100
And the immediate question
should be well, why?

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.670
Well, the answer is that
when we pay careful attention

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.392
there are two neurochemicals,

00:38:04.392 --> 00:38:06.750
neuromodulators as they're called,

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.040
that are released from
multiple sites in our brain

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.310
that highlight the neural circuits

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.460
that stand a chance of changing.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.800
Now it's not necessarily the case
that they're going to change,

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.860
but it's the first gate that has to open

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.350
in order for change to occur.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.773
And the first neurochemical is
epinephrin, also adrenaline.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.580
We call it adrenaline

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.560
when it's released from the adrenal glands

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.540
above our kidneys, that's in the body,

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.050
we call it epinephrin in the brain,

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.803
but they are chemically
identical substances.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.110
Epinephrin is released from
a region in the brainstem

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.000
called locus coeruleus.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.500
Fancy name, you don't need to
know it unless you want to.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.810
Locus coeruleus sends
out these little wires

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:55.120
we call axons such that
it hoses the entire brain

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.400
essentially in this
neurochemical, epinephrin.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.820
Now it's not always hosing
the brain with epinephrin.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.500
It's only when we are in
high states of alertness

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.460
that this epinephrin is released.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.260
But the way this circuit is
designed, it's very nonspecific.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.370
It's essentially waking
up the entire brain

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.440
and that's because the
way that epinephrin works

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.020
by binding particular receptors

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:19.250
is to increase the likelihood
that neurons will be active.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:23.190
So no alertness, no neuroplasticity.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:26.610
However, alertness
alone is not sufficient.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.070
As we would say, it's necessary

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.533
but not sufficient for neuroplasticity.

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.220
We know this is true also from
the work of Hubel and Wiesel

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.920
where they looked at brain plasticity

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.120
in response to certain experiences

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.910
in subjects that were
either awake or asleep.

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.650
And I hate to break it to you

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:47.780
but you cannot just simply
listen to things in your sleep

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.250
and learn those materials.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.080
Later I'll talk about how
you can do certain things

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.300
in your sleep that you're unaware of

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.540
that can enhance learning of
things that you were aware of

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.830
while you were awake.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:01.480
But that is not the same as
just listening to some music

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.030
or listening to a tape while you sleep

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.593
and expecting it to sink in, so to speak.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.180
Epinephrin is released
when we pay attention

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.090
and when we are alert.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.580
But the most important
thing for getting plasticity

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.940
is that there'll be epinephrin
which equates to alertness,

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.760
plus the release of this
neuromodulator, acetylcholine.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.880
Now acetylcholine is released
from two sites in the brain.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.560
One is also in the brainstem
and it's named different things

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.410
in different animals, but in humans

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:34.520
the most rich site of
acetylcholine neurons

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.310
or neurons that make acetylcholine

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:41.310
is the parabigeminal nucleus
or the parabrachial region.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.370
There are a number of different names

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.720
of these aggregates of neurons.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.930
You don't need to know the names,

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.180
all you need to know is
that you have an area

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.110
in your brainstem and
that area sends wires,

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:52.910
these axons up into the area of the brain

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.220
that filters sensory input.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.290
So we have this area of the
brain called the thalamus

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:59.440
and it is getting bombarded with all sorts

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.100
of sensory input all the time.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.390
Costello snoring off to my right,

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.490
the lights that are in the room,

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.810
the presence of my computer to my left,

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:09.380
all of that is coming in.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.270
But when I pay attention to something

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.150
like if I really hone
in on Costello snoring,

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.740
I create a cone of attention

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.680
and what that cone of attention reflects

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:23.680
is that acetylcholine is now
amplifying the signal of sounds

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.630
that Costello is making with his snoring

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.160
and essentially making that signal greater

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.650
than all the signal around it,

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.840
what we call signal-to-noise goes up.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.460
So those of you with an
engineering background

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.100
will be familiar with signal-to-noise.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.830
Those of you who do not have
an engineering background,

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:39.663
don't worry about it.

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:43.050
All it means is that one
particular shout in the crowd

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:46.140
comes through, Costello's
snoring becomes more salient,

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.370
more apparent relative to
everything else going on.

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.920
Acetylcholine acts as a spotlight

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:54.980
but epinephrin for alertness.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.440
acetylcholine spotlighting these inputs.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.680
Those two things alone are
not enough to get plasticity.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.280
There needs to be this third component.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.760
And the third component
is acetylcholine released

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.210
from an area of the forebrain
called nucleus basalis.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.360
If you really want to get technical,

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.290
it's called nucleus basalis of Meynert.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:15.770
For any of you that
are buddying physicians

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.050
or going to medical school,
you should know that.

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:22.040
If you have acetylcholine
released from the brainstem,

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.330
acetylcholine released from
nucleus basalis and epinephrin,

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:27.580
you can change your brain.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.580
And I can say that with confidence

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.760
because Merzenich and Recanzone

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.460
as well as other members
of the Merzenich lab,

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.950
Michael Kilgard and others

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:39.540
did these incredible experiments
where they stimulated

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.490
the release of acetylcholine
from nucleus basalis

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:44.680
either with an electrode
or with some other methods

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.060
that we'll talk about.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.170
And what they found was when you stimulate

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.230
these three brain
regions, locus coeruleus,

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:54.690
the brainstem source of acetylcholine

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:57.400
and then the basal forebrain
source of acetylcholine.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.200
When you have those three things

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.730
whatever you happen to
be listening to, doing

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:08.200
or paying attention to
immediately in one trial

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.240
takes over the representation

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.110
of a particular area of the brain.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:16.200
You essentially get rapid
massive learning in one shop.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.560
And this has been shown
again and again and again

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.820
in a variety of papers

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.630
also by a guy named Norman
Weinberger from UC Irvine.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.560
And it is now considered
a fundamental principle

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.780
of how the nervous system works.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.060
So while Hubel and Wiesel
talked about critical periods

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.970
in developmental plasticity,

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.760
it's very clear from the work of Merzenich

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.300
and Weinberg and others, that
if you get these three things,

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.200
if you can access these three things

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.070
of epinephrin, acetylcholine
from these two sources,

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:46.740
not only will the nervous
system change, it has to change.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.180
It absolutely will change.

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.900
And that is the most important thing

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.790
for people to understand if
they want to change their brain.

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:56.560
You cannot just passively
experience things

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.440
and repetition can be important,

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.960
but the way to use repetition
to change your brain

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.570
is fundamentally different.

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.980
So now let's talk about
how we would translate

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.500
all the scientific information and history

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.900
into some protocols that
you can actually apply,

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.740
because I think that's what
many of you're interested in.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.400
And I'm willing to bet that
most of you are not interested

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.760
in lowering electrodes
into your nucleus basalis

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.340
and frankly, neither am I.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.060
In episode one of the
Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.530
I described the various
ways that people can monitor

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.310
and change their nervous system.

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.600
Those ways include brain
machine interface, pharmacology,

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.500
behavioral practices,

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.490
and those behavioral practices of course

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.330
can include some dos, do this

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:39.480
and some don'ts, don't do that, et cetera

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.690
In thinking about neuroplasticity,

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:43.270
I want to have a very frank conversation

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:44.800
about what one can do

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.930
but also acknowledge
this untapped capacity

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.930
that I'm just not hearing about out there,

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:53.380
which is one can also
combine behavioral practices

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:54.580
with pharmacology.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:57.490
One can combine behavioral practices

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.190
with brain machine interface,
and you don't have to do that.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:03.820
In fact, I'm not recommending
you do anything in particular.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.900
As always, I'll say it again,

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.300
I'm not a physician, so I
don't prescribe anything.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.280
I'm a professor, so I
profess a lot of things.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.330
What you do with your health

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:13.800
and your medical care is up to you.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.710
You're responsible for
your health and wellbeing.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.530
So I'm not going to tell you
what to do or what to take.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:21.350
I'm going to describe what
the literature tells us

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.060
and suggests about ways
to access plasticity.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.680
We know we need epinephrin,
that means alertness.

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.030
Most people accomplish this
through a cup of coffee

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:30.180
and a good night's sleep.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.900
So I will say you should
master your sleep schedule

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.270
and you should figure out
how much sleep you need

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:39.143
in order to achieve alertness
when you sit down to learn.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.730
All the tools and more
science than probably

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.580
you ever wanted to hear about sleep

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.820
and how to get better at
sleeping and timing your sleep

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.810
et cetera and naps and all of that

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.840
is in episodes two, three, four, and five

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.040
of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.760
So I encourage you to refer to those

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.310
if your sleep is not where
you would like it to be.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.510
Your ability to engage in
deliberate focused alertness

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.290
is in direct proportion to
how well you are sleeping

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:04.390
on a regular basis.

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:06.270
I think that's kind of an obvious one.

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.200
So get your sleep handled.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.610
But once that's in place,

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:15.000
the question then is how
do I access this alertness?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.430
Well, there are a number of ways.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.970
Some people use some pretty elaborate

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:20.490
psychological gymnastics.

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.460
They will tell people that
they're going to do something

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.150
and create some accountability.

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:26.370
That could be really good.

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.500
Or they'll post a picture
of themselves online

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.540
and they'll commit to
learning a certain amount

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.130
losing, excuse me, a
certain amount of weight

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:33.300
or something like this.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:37.760
So they can use either
shame-based practices

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.310
to potentially embarrass themselves

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:40.340
if they don't follow through.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.430
They'll write cheques to
organizations that they hate

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:43.800
and insist that they'll cash them

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.650
if they don't actually follow through

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.100
or they'll do it out of love,

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.510
you know, they'll decide
that they're going

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:54.110
to run a marathon or learn
a language or something

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:55.410
because of somebody they love

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:57.580
or they want to devote it to somebody.

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:01.090
The truth is that from the
standpoint of epinephrin

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:03.920
and getting alert and activated,
it doesn't really matter.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.610
Epinephrin is a chemical and
your brain does not distinguish

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.710
between doing things out of
love or hate, anger or fear.

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:14.530
It really doesn't, all of
those promote autonomic arousal

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:15.760
and the release of epinephrin.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.350
So I think for most people

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.750
if you're feeling not
motivated to make these changes

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.130
the key thing is to identify not just one

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:26.680
but probably at kit of reasons,
several reasons as to why

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.830
you would want to make
this particular change

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:31.680
and being drawn toward a particular goal

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.220
that you're excited about can be one,

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:38.060
also being motivated to not
be completely afraid, ashamed,

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.500
or humiliated for not following through

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.420
on a goal is another.

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.960
I just want to briefly
mention one little aside there

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.840
because I've got a
friend who's a physician,

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.430
he's a cardiologist who has
a really interesting theory.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:49.120
This is just theory, but
I think it will resonate

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.400
with a lot of people, which is that,

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.150
you've all heard of this molecule dopamine

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:55.750
that gives us the sense of reward

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:57.140
when we accomplish something.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.850
Well, we also want to be
able to access dopamine

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.050
while we're working towards things,

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:02.770
enjoy the process as they say,

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.810
'cause it has all sorts
of positive effects

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:06.340
gives us energy, et cetera.

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.460
With my friend, what he says is, you know,

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.739
there's many many instances
where someone will come to him

00:48:10.739 --> 00:48:13.830
and say, "You know what,
I'm going to write a book."

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:15.360
And he says, "Oh, that's great.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.630
I'm sure the book's going to be terrific

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:17.920
and you really should write a book."

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.940
And then they never go do it.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.220
And his theory is, if
you get so much dopamine

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.990
from the reward of people saying,

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:24.940
Oh yeah, you're absolutely
going to be able to do that,

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.430
you might not actually go after the reward

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.050
of the accomplishment itself.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:32.160
So be aware these positive
reinforcements also.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.250
I'm not saying people
should flagellate themselves

00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:36.880
to the point of victory in
whatever they're pursuing,

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.380
but motivation is a tricky one.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.520
So I suggest that everyone asks themselves

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.530
what is it that I want to accomplish?

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:47.660
And what is it that's
driving me to accomplish this

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.660
and come up with two or three things.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.440
Fear-based perhaps, love-based perhaps

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.460
or perhaps several of
those in order to ensure

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:59.860
alertness, energy and
attention for the task.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.060
And that brings us to the attention part.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.780
Now it's one thing to
have an electrode embedded

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.800
into your brain and increase
the amount of acetylcholine.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.630
It's another to exist in the real world

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.840
outside the laboratory
and have trouble focusing.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.010
Having trouble bringing your attention

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:17.580
to a particular location in
space for a particular event.

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.510
And there's a lot of discussion
nowadays about smartphones

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:24.253
and devices creating a
sort of attention deficit,

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.210
almost at a clinical
level for many people,

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:28.760
including adults.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.550
I think that's largely true.

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:33.620
And what it means, however,
is that we all are responsible

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.903
for learning how to create depth of focus.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.870
There are some important
Neuroscience principles

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:41.810
to get depth of focus.

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:44.040
I want to briefly talk
about the pharmacology first

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.390
because I always get asked about this.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:47.620
People say, "What can I
take to increase my levels

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.800
of acetylcholine?"

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.560
Well, there are things you can take.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.210
Nicotine is called nicotine

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:56.700
because acetylcholine binds
to the nicotinic receptor.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.460
There are two kinds of
acetylcholine receptors,

00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.520
muscarinic and nicotinic,

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.960
but the nicotinic ones are involved

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.693
in attention and alertness.

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:07.210
I have colleagues, these
are not my, you know

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:10.200
kind of like bro, science
buddies, I have those friends too,

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.060
this is a Nobel prize winning colleague

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.400
who chews Nicorette while he works.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.390
He used to be a smoker.

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:19.800
He quit smoking because
of fear of lung cancer,

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.260
seemed like a smart choice,

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.910
but he missed the level of focus

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.150
that he could bring to his work.

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:28.110
This is somebody who has
had very long career.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:29.880
And if you ever meet with him,

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.080
unfortunately I can't name him.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.740
If you ever meet with him
what you realize is he chews

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.540
about five pieces of Nicorette an hour,

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.830
which I am not suggesting people do.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:39.150
But when I asked him,
"Why are you doing this?"

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:42.250
He said, "Well, increases
my alertness and focus."

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:45.100
And also his theory and I
want to really underscore

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.610
that it's theory not
scientifically supported yet,

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:50.910
is that it offsets
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:53.010
It is true that nucleus basalis

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:56.910
is the primary site of
degeneration in the brain,

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:59.370
in people that have
dementia and Parkinson's

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:01.740
and it's what leads to
a lot of their inability

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:05.640
to focus their attention, not
just deficits and plasticity.

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.440
So he might be onto something.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.260
Now I've tried chewing Nicorette,
it makes me super jittery.

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.620
I don't like it because
I can't focus very well.

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.980
It kind of takes me too far up

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.780
the level of autonomic arousal.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.060
I've got friends that
dip Nicorette all day,

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:21.520
some of whom are scientists,
writers and artists

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.360
and musicians are familiar
with the effects of nicotine

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.220
from the era where a lot of people smoked

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.680
and fortunately fewer people smoke now.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.690
So if you're interested
in the pharmacology,

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:32.010
there are supplements and things

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:34.810
that can increase cholinergic
transmission in the brain.

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:36.970
I'm not suggesting you do this

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:39.530
but if you're going to go down that route,

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:41.780
you want to be very
careful how much you rely

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.490
on those all the time.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:47.240
Because the essence of
plasticity is to create a window

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.410
of attention and focus that's distinct

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:50.550
from the rest of your day.

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:53.740
That's what's going to
create a mark in your brain

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.970
and the potential for plasticity.

00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:57.710
Things that increase acetylcholine,

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:01.130
besides nicotine or Nicorette,

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:03.930
the nicotine could come
from a variety of sources

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:07.420
or things like alpha-GPC or choline.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:08.470
There are a number of these things.

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:11.730
I would encourage you to go
to examine.com, the website

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:13.100
and just put in acetylcholine

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.050
and it will give you a list of supplements

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:17.100
as well as some of the
dangers of these supplements

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.310
that are associated with
cholinergic transmission.

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:22.030
But I would be remiss and I would be lying

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:24.610
if I didn't say that there
are a lot of people out there

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:28.210
who are using cholinergic drugs

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:31.200
in order to increase their level of focus.

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.230
And since we're coming up on the Olympics,

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:34.320
I don't want to get anyone in trouble

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.920
but I'm well aware that
the fact that the sprinters

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.980
are really into cholinergic drugs

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.940
because not only is acetylcholine
important for the focus

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:44.250
that allows them to hear the gun

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:46.390
and be first out the
blocks on the sprints.

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:49.100
That's a lot of where the race is won,

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.700
hearing that gun and being
the quickest on reaction time.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:53.840
So they take cholinergic agents for that

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.030
as well as acetylcholine is the molecule

00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:59.530
that controls nerve to muscle contraction.

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:01.790
So your speed of reflexes
is actually controlled

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:04.290
by this nicotinic transmission as well.

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:06.800
So lots to think about
in terms of acetylcholine

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.010
in sport and mental acuity,
not just plasticity.

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.490
Now for most of you,

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:14.230
you probably don't want to chew Nicorette,

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:15.470
definitely don't want to smoke cigarettes

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:18.400
or take supplements for
increasing acetylcholine.

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.630
So what are some ways that you
can increase acetylcholine?

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:23.490
And there, it's going to sound

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:26.870
like a bit of a circular argument
but you to increase focus.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.730
How do you increase focus?

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:30.840
You know, people are so
familiar with sitting down,

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.130
reading a couple pages of a book

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:33.640
and realizing that none of it sunk in

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.620
or talking to someone and
seeing their mouth move,

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.770
maybe even nodding your
head subconsciously

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:41.380
and none of it sinks in.

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.060
This can be very damaging
for school, work performance

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.293
and relationships as many of you know.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.980
Costello incidentally never
seems to pay attention

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.450
to anything I say while
looking directly at me,

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:55.150
which contradicts what I'm about to say,

00:53:55.150 --> 00:54:00.000
which is that the best way
to get better at focusing

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.460
is to use the mechanisms of
focus that you were born with.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:08.360
And the key principle
here is that mental focus

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.313
follows visual focus.

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:13.760
We are all familiar with the
fact that our visual system

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.460
can be unfocused, blurry or jumping around

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:21.440
or we can be very laser focused
on one location in space.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.870
What's interesting and vitally important

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:26.620
to understanding how to
access neuroplasticity

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:29.430
is that you can use your visual focus

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:32.630
and you can increase your
visual focus as a way

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:37.050
of increasing your mental
focus abilities more broadly.

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:38.800
So I'm going to explain how to do that.

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.730
Plasticity starts with alertness.

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.090
And as I mentioned before,

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:46.260
that alertness can come
from a sense of love,

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:49.433
a sense of joy, a sense
of fear, doesn't matter.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:53.720
There are pharmacologic ways
to access alertness too.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.530
The most common one is of course caffeine

00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:58.380
which if you watch the sleep episodes,

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.140
you know reduces this molecule

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:02.510
that makes us sleepy called adenosine.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:04.670
I drink plenty of caffeine.

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:07.200
I'm a heavy user of caffeine.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.060
I don't think abuser of caffeine.

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.170
I think in reasonable amounts

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:12.200
provided we can still
fall asleep at night,

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.250
caffeine can be a relatively safe way

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.663
to increase epinephrin.

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:21.980
Now, many people are
now also using Adderall.

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:25.470
Adderall chemically looks
a lot like amphetamine

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:27.930
and basically it is amphetamine.

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:30.350
It will increase epinephrin
release from locus coeruleus,

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:31.890
it will wake up the brain

00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:33.660
and that's why a lot of people rely on it.

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:38.470
It does have a heavy basis for use

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:40.810
in certain clinical syndromes prescribed

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:43.110
such as attention deficit.

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:47.530
However, it also has a
high probability of abuse

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:50.060
especially in those who
are not prescribed it.

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.660
Adderall will not increase
focus, it increases alertness.

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.360
It does not touch the
acetylcholine system.

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.807
And if those of you that
are taking Adderall say,

00:55:58.807 --> 00:56:01.540
"Well, it really increases
my focus overall",

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.930
that's probably because your
autonomic nervous system

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:06.840
is just veering towards what
we call parasympathetic.

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.370
You're really just very sleepy

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:11.150
and so it's bringing your
levels of alertness up.

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:13.630
As I mentioned, Adderall
is very problematic

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:16.700
for a number of people as
it can be habit forming.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.610
Learning on Adderall
does not always translate

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:23.570
to high-performance off or
on Adderall at later times.

00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:26.200
And the Adderall
discussion is a broader one

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.790
that perhaps we should have
with a psychiatrist in the room

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:32.270
at some point because it is
a very widely abused drug

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:33.513
at this point in time.

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.310
The acetylcholine system

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:39.830
and the focus that it brings is available

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:41.410
as I mentioned through pharmacology,

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:43.690
but also through these
behavioral practices.

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:45.740
And the behavioral practices

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:48.700
that are anchored in visual
focus are going to be the ones

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:51.850
that are going to allow
you to develop great depth

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:53.800
and duration of focus.

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.570
So let's think about
visual focus for a second.

00:56:56.570 --> 00:57:01.230
When we focus on something
visually, we have two options.

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:04.820
We can either look at a
very small region of space

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:07.660
with a lot of detail
and a lot of precision

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.360
or we can dilate our gaze
and we can see big pieces

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.300
of visual space with very little detail.

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.133
It's a trade-off.

00:57:13.133 --> 00:57:15.270
We can't look at everything
at high resolution.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.510
This is why we have these,

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:19.940
the pupil more or less relates
to the fovea of the eye

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.100
which is the area in which
we have the most receptors,

00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:25.070
the highest density of
receptors that perceive light.

00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:26.710
And so our acuity is much better

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.880
in the center of our visual
field than our periphery.

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.330
It's a simple experiment
you can do right now.

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:33.020
If you're listening to
this, you can still do it.

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.910
You can hold your feet or your
hands out in front of you.

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:36.610
Provided that you're sighted
you should be able to see

00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:38.600
how many fingers you have in front of you.

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.433
For me, it's five.

00:57:39.433 --> 00:57:42.033
I still got all five
fingers, amazingly enough.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.900
If I move my hand off to the side,

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.720
I can't see them with precision,

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.040
but as I moved them back into
the center of my visual field

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.510
I can see them with precision.

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:53.150
And that's because the density,

00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:55.080
the number of pixels in the
center of my visual field

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.370
is much higher than it
is in the periphery.

00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:00.290
When we focus our eyes,
we do a couple of things.

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:02.290
First of all, we tend to do that

00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:03.540
in the center of our visual field

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.010
and our two eyes tend to align

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:06.390
in what's called a vergence eye movement

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:08.520
towards a common point.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.840
The other thing that happens
is the lens of our eye moves

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.660
so that our brain now no longer
sees the entire visual world

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:18.031
but is seeing a small
cone of visual imagery.

00:58:18.031 --> 00:58:19.609
[door banging]
If it...

00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:22.610
That was the dog bumping
into the wall, forgive me.

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:24.820
That small cone of visual imagery

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.720
or soda straw view of the
world has much higher acuity,

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.663
higher resolution than if I
were to look at everything.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.900
Now you see, of course,
this makes perfect sense

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.410
but that's about visual
attention, not mental attention.

00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:41.390
Well, it turns out that focus in the brain

00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:43.880
is anchored to our visual system.

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.420
I'll talk about blind people in a moment

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.070
but assuming that somebody is sighted,

00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:51.330
the key is to learn how
to focus better visually,

00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:55.000
if you want to bring about
higher levels of cognitive

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.550
or mental focus, even if you're
engaged in a physical task.

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:02.500
Now there's a remarkable
phenomenon in animals

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.780
where animals that have their
eyes on the side of their head

00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:08.250
are scanning the entire visual
environment all the time.

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:09.340
They're not focused on anything.

00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:11.640
Think you're grazing animals,
your cows, your sheep

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.120
your birds, et cetera.

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.390
But think about a bird
picking up seeds on the beach

00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:18.130
or on concrete.

00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:20.430
That bird's head is up here.

00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:22.010
It's up about a foot off the ground,

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.700
or if it's a small bird about
six inches off the ground

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.440
and its eyes are on the side of its head

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:27.870
and yet it has this tiny beak

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:30.280
that can quickly pick up these
little seeds off the ground

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:32.470
with immense precision.

00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:35.310
Now, if you try to do that by staring off

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:37.380
to the sides of the room
and picking up items

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:40.260
in front of you with high
precision at that tiny scale,

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:43.300
little tiny objects, you
will miss almost every time.

00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:45.580
They do it perfectly and
they don't smash their beak

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:46.580
into the ground and damage it,

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.490
they do it with beautiful
movement acuity also.

00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:51.910
So how do they do it?

00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:55.340
How do they create this
focus or this awareness

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:56.180
of what's in front of them?

00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:58.800
It turns out as they lower their head,

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.220
their eyes, very briefly move inward,

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.310
in what's called a vergence eye movement.

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:07.960
Now their eyes can't actually
translocate in their head,

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:10.550
they're fixed in the skull,
just like yours and mine are.

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:13.970
But when we move our eyes slightly inward,

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:17.180
maybe you can tell and do it's like so

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:21.160
basically shortening or making
the inter pupillary distance

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.170
as it's called smaller.

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.070
Two things happen.

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:27.300
Not only do we develop
a smaller visual window

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:31.150
into the world, but we
activate a set of neurons

01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:34.000
in our brainstem that trigger the release

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.130
of both norepinephrine,
epinephrin and acetylcholine.

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:40.300
Norepinephrine is kind
of similar to epinephrin.

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.610
So in other words, when our
eyes are relaxed in our head

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:44.470
when we're just kind of looking

01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:46.610
at our entire visual environment,
moving our head around,

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:48.630
moving through space we're in optic flow,

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.240
things moving past us
or we're sitting still,

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.820
we're looking broadly at
our space, we're relaxed.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.240
When our eyes move slightly inward

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.150
toward a particular visual target

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:03.000
our visual world shrinks, our
level of visual focus goes up

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.110
and we know that this relates

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:07.780
to the release of
acetylcholine and epinephrin

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.870
at the relevant sites in
the brain for plasticity.

01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:12.170
Now, what this means is that

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:15.600
if you have a hard time focusing your mind

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.430
for sake of reading or for
listening, you need to practice

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:22.860
and you can practice
focusing your visual system.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.420
Now this works best if you practice

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.500
focusing your visual system
at the precise distance,

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.680
from the work that you intend
to do for sake of plasticity.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.920
So how would this look in the real world?

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.260
Let's say, I am trying to
concentrate on something

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.240
related to, I don't know, science,

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.060
I'm reading a science paper
and I'm having a hard time,

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.880
it's not absorbing.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.190
I might think that I'm
only looking at the paper

01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:46.023
that I'm reading.

01:01:46.023 --> 01:01:47.020
I'm only looking at my screen,

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.470
but actually my eyes are
probably darting around a bit.

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:51.060
Experiments have been done on this.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.028
Or I'm gathering information
from too many sources

01:01:54.028 --> 01:01:55.890
in the visual environment.

01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:57.820
Now, presumably because it's me,

01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:59.900
I've already had my coffee, I'm hydrated.

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.980
I'm well rested, I slept well.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:05.160
And I still experienced
these challenges in focusing

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:10.160
spending just 60 to 120 seconds
focusing my visual attention

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.960
on a small window of my screen,

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.760
meaning just on my screen
with nothing on it,

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.130
but bringing my eyes to
that particular location

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:22.360
increases not just my visual
acuity for that location

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.530
but it brings about an
increase in activity

01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:28.870
in a bunch of other brain
areas that are associated

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:33.400
with gathering information
from this location.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.080
So put simply, if you want to
improve your ability to focus

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.120
practice visual focus.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.430
Now, if you wear contacts

01:02:42.661 --> 01:02:45.080
or you wear corrective
lenses, that's fine.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.540
You of course would want to use those.

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:50.040
You don't want to take those
off and use a blurry image.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.260
The finer the visual image
and the more that you can hold

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.070
your gaze to the visual image,

01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:58.360
the higher your levels
of attention will be.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.710
Many times on Instagram
and here I've been teased

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.120
for not blinking very often.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.010
That's actually a practiced thing.

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:07.160
We blink more as we get
tired, which as you hear it

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.640
you'll probably just say, duh.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.230
As we get tired, the
neurons in the brainstem

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:12.810
that are responsible for alertness

01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:14.600
and that hold the eyelids open

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.880
start to falter and our
eyelids start to close.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.457
This is why it's hard, the words,

01:03:18.457 --> 01:03:20.320
"I could barely keep my eyes open"

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.050
which may be how you feel right now.

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:25.000
But assuming that you're paying
attention and you're alert,

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:28.020
when you're very alert,
your eyes are wide,

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.510
your eyes are open.

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:32.260
And as you get tired, your
eyelids start to close.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.570
Blinks, actually reset our
perception of time and space.

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:38.720
This was shown in a beautiful
paper in Current Biology.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.640
I'll be sure to post the
reference in the notes.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.250
And blinking of course is
necessary to lubricate the eyes.

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:47.470
People blink because
their eyes might get dry.

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:51.270
But if you can keep
focused by blinking less

01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:53.440
and by focusing your eyes
to a particular location

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.340
that's probably pretty
creepy for you to experience

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.430
as I'm doing this.

01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:57.970
But the more that you can do this

01:03:57.970 --> 01:04:00.760
the more that you can
maintain a kind of a cone

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.980
or a tunnel of mental focus.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.910
And so I'm sort of revealing my practice

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:09.320
which is that I've worked very
hard through blinking contest

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.990
with my 14-year-old niece
who still beats me every time

01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.940
and it really bothers me,

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.780
but also just through my own self practice

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:19.600
of learning to blink less
and focus my visual attention

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.060
on a smaller region of space.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.810
Now for me, that's important

01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:26.980
because I'm mainly learning
things on a computer screen.

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.510
If you're going to be doing
sport, it's quite a bit different

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:31.660
and we can discuss how you might
translate to that to sport.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.500
In fact, in the next episode,
I'm going to talk all about

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.610
how plasticity and the
focus mechanisms relate

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:40.920
to learning of movement practices
and coordinated movements.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.920
It's an entire discussion unto itself

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.070
but the same principle holds.

01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:45.970
So we need alertness.

01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:50.280
You can get that through
mental tricks of motivation,

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.580
fear or love, whatever it is,

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.470
pharmacology, please do it healthfully.

01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:57.760
You know, caffeine if
that's in your practice,

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.420
certainly want to be well hydrated

01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:02.360
that increases actually
will increase alertness.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.190
Well, having a very full
bladder will increase alertness

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:06.890
although you don't want
your alertness to be so high

01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:08.170
that all you can think about

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.200
is the fact that you have to go urinate

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.610
'cause that's very distracting.

01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:14.083
You don't want your alertness
to go through the roof.

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:18.190
You need focus and visual
focus is the primary way

01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.330
in which we start to deploy
these neurochemicals.

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:24.870
Now you may ask, well,
what about the experiment

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:27.190
where people were feeling
this rotating drum

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.470
or listening to the auditory cue

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.800
that doesn't involve vision at all?

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.050
If you look at people
who are learning things

01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:35.280
with their auditory system,

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.860
they will often close their eyes.

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.410
And that's not a coincidence.

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:41.820
If somebody is listening very
hard, please don't ask them

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.100
to look you directly in the eye

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.030
while also asking that they listen to you.

01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:46.440
That's actually one of the worst ways

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.273
to get somebody to listen to you.

01:05:47.273 --> 01:05:49.600
If you say, now listen to
me and look me in the eye.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.800
The visual system will take over

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.950
and they'll see your mouth move,

01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:53.090
but they're going to hear their thoughts

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:55.740
more than they're going to
hear what you're saying.

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:58.040
Closing the eyes is one of the best ways

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.660
to create a cone of auditory attention.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.260
And this is what low vision
or no vision folks do.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:06.110
They have tremendous capacity
to focus their attention

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:08.160
in particular locations.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.410
Incidentally does anyone
know the two animals

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:12.940
that have the best hearing in the world?

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.760
The absolute best hearing
is many orders of magnitude

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.140
better than humans.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.530
It turns out it's the elephant.

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:21.010
That might not surprise
you, they have huge ears

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.020
and the moth which
probably will surprise you.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.300
I didn't even know that moths could hear.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.773
but now it explains why
they're so hard to catch.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.900
If you are not sighted,
you learn how to do this

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.970
with your hearing.

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:36.230
If you're somebody who braille reads,

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:37.890
you learn how to do
this with your fingers.

01:06:37.890 --> 01:06:42.890
If you look at great piano
players like Glenn Gould,

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.730
they often times will turn
their head to the side.

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:50.430
You think about some
of the great musicians

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:53.550
like Stevie Wonder that were blind, right?

01:06:53.550 --> 01:06:55.370
He would look away
because he had no reason

01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:58.790
to look at the keys, but
oftentimes they'll orient an ear

01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:01.270
or one side of their head
to the keys on the piano.

01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:03.050
As I mentioned before,
people who are non-sighted

01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:03.883
have better pitch.

01:07:03.883 --> 01:07:06.710
So we have these cones of
attention that we can devote.

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:09.370
And for most people,
vision is the primary way

01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:12.040
to train up this focus of
building these cones of attention.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.640
So you absolutely have to focus

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.220
on the thing that you're trying to learn.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.500
And you will feel some agitation

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.160
because of the epinephrin in your system.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.027
If you're feeling agitation
and it's challenging to focus

01:07:23.027 --> 01:07:24.760
and you're feeling like
you're not doing it right

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.860
chances are you're doing it right.

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.730
And you can practice this ability to stare

01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:31.890
for long periods of time without blinking.

01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:34.080
I know it's a little
eerie for people to watch,

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.100
but if your goal is to
learn how to control

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:39.170
that visual window for sake
of controlling your focus,

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:41.390
it can be an immensely powerful portal

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.490
into these mechanisms of plasticity,

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:46.587
because we know it engages
things like nucleus basalis

01:07:46.587 --> 01:07:49.120
and these other brainstem mechanisms.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.420
I get a lot of questions
about attention deficit

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.760
hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.070
and attention deficit disorder.

01:07:56.070 --> 01:07:59.580
Some people actually have
clinically diagnosed ADD and ADHD.

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.930
And if you do, you should certainly work

01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:04.150
with a good psychiatrist
to try and figure out

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:08.190
the right pharmacology and/or
behavioral practices for you.

01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:12.730
Many people, however, have given
themselves a low grade ADHD

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:15.150
or ADD because of the way that they move

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:16.890
through their world.

01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:19.450
They are looking at their
phone a lot of the time.

01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:21.260
It's actually very easy
to anchor your attention

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.830
to your phone for the following reason.

01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:25.560
First of all, it's very
restricted in size.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.030
So it's very easy to limit
your visual attention

01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:30.320
to something about this big.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.870
It's one of the design
features of the phone.

01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:36.830
The other, is that just
as you've probably heard

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:39.040
a picture is worth a thousand words,

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.790
well, a movie is worth 10,000 pictures.

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:45.510
Anytime we're looking at
things that have motion,

01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:48.000
visual motion, our attentional system

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.020
will naturally gravitate towards
them, towards those movies.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:55.120
It's actually much harder
to read words on a page

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.430
than it used to be for many people,

01:08:57.430 --> 01:09:00.530
because we're used to seeing
things spelled out for us

01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:01.834
in YouTube videos or videos

01:09:01.834 --> 01:09:05.950
where things move in a very dramatic.

01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:07.690
It is true that the more that we look

01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:10.060
at those motion stimulate,

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:11.530
the more that we're
seeing movies of things

01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:14.700
and things that are very
dramatic and very intense,

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.120
the worst we're getting
at attending to things

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.320
like text on a page or
to listening to something

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.660
like a podcast and
extracting the information

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.577
so much so that I think
many people have asked me,

01:09:26.577 --> 01:09:29.470
"Hey you know what, why aren't
you providing intense visuals

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:30.303
for us to look at?"

01:09:30.303 --> 01:09:31.580
Well, frankly, it's
because a lot of people

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:34.200
are consuming this content
through pure auditory,

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.530
through, it's by listening.

01:09:35.530 --> 01:09:38.440
And I want them to be able
to digest all the material.

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.970
But in addition to that,

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:42.620
if you think about the areas of life

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.010
that dictate whether or
not we become successful,

01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:47.453
independent, healthy individuals,

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:52.730
most of those involve the
kind of boring practices

01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:55.350
of digesting information on a page.

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:58.530
Boring because it's not as
exciting in the moment perhaps

01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:02.730
as watching a movie or
something being spoonfed to us.

01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:04.790
But the more attention that
we can put to something,

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:06.530
even if it's fleeting and we feel like

01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:08.360
we're only getting little bits and pieces,

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.680
shards of the information as
opposed to the entire thing,

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.400
that has a much more powerful effect

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.460
in engaging this cholinergic
system for plasticity

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:19.350
than does, for instance, watching a movie.

01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:22.500
And that's because when we watch a movie,

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.560
the entire thing can be
great, it can be awesome.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.280
It can be this overriding experience

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.220
but I think for all those experiences,

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.750
if you're somebody who's
interested in building your brain

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:32.620
and expanding your brain

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.540
and getting better at various things,

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:37.370
in feeling better,
doing better, et cetera,

01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:40.900
one has to ask how much of
my neurochemical resources

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.150
am I devoting to the passive experience

01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:45.330
of letting something,
just kind of overwhelm me

01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:46.710
and excite me,

01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:48.480
versus something that I'm
really trying to learn

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.560
and take away.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.393
And now there's another

01:10:50.393 --> 01:10:53.530
I enjoy movie content and
TV content all the time.

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:55.770
I scroll Instagram often.

01:10:55.770 --> 01:11:00.410
But we are limited in the extent
to which we can grab a hold

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:03.780
of these acetylcholine release
mechanisms or epinephrin.

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:06.350
And I think that we need to be careful

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:10.420
that we don't devote all our
acetylcholine and epinephrin,

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.240
all our dopamine for that matter

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.260
to these passive experiences of things

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:17.120
that are not going to
enrich us and better us.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.110
So that's a little bit of
an editorial on my part

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:23.850
but the phone is rich with movies,

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:25.150
it's rich with information.

01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:26.610
The real question is

01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:31.610
is the information rich
for us in ways that grow us

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.680
and cultivate smarter,
more emotionally, you know

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:41.500
emotionally evolved
people, or is it creating

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.480
what's it doing for our physical
wellbeing for that matter?

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.960
So I don't want to tell
people what to do or not to do

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.990
but think carefully about
how often you're focusing

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:53.710
on something and how good
you are or poor you are

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:56.790
at focusing on something
that's challenging.

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:58.850
So once you get this
epinephrin, this alertness,

01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:00.940
you get the acetylcholine released

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:03.090
and you can focus your attention.

01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.690
Then the question is for how long?

01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:06.180
And in an earlier podcast,

01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.910
I talked about these ultradian cycles

01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:09.670
that lasts about 90 minutes.

01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:12.700
The typical learning about
should be about 90 minutes.

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.180
I think that learning about will no doubt

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:18.610
include five to 10
minutes of warmup period.

01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:20.850
I think everyone should
give themselves permission

01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:24.400
to not be fully focused in
the early part of that about.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.280
But that in the middle of that about

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.260
for the middle hour or so

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.880
you should be able to maintain focus

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.270
for about an hour or so.

01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:32.920
So that for me means
eliminating distractions.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.770
That means turning off the wifi.

01:12:34.770 --> 01:12:36.390
I put my phone in the other room.

01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:39.580
If I find myself reflexively
getting up to get the phone

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:41.730
I will take the phone and
lock it in the car outside.

01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:43.890
If I find myself going to get it anyway,

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:48.550
I am guilty of giving away
the phone for a period of time

01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:50.860
or even things more dramatic,

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.740
I've thrown it up on my roof before

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.770
so I can't get to it
till the end of the day.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.260
That thing is pretty compelling

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:57.630
and we come up with all sorts of reasons

01:12:57.630 --> 01:12:59.550
why we need it, to be in contact with it

01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:02.280
but I encourage you to try experiencing

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.420
what it is to be completely
immersed in an activity

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:07.960
where you feel the agitation
that your attention is drifting

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.530
but you continually bring it back.

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:10.720
And that's an important point

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.830
which is that attention drifts,
but we have to re-anchor it.

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:15.310
We have to keep grabbing it back.

01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:18.210
And the way to do that, if
you're sighted is with your eyes.

01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:20.010
That as your attention
drifts, and you look away

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:23.250
you want to try and literally
maintain visual focus

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:24.630
on the thing that you're trying to learn.

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:26.220
Feel free to blink, of course,

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.770
but you can greatly increase
your powers of focus

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:31.310
and the rates of learning
which is anchored

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:34.570
in all the work of Merzenich,
Hubel and Wiesel and others.

01:13:34.570 --> 01:13:37.120
Now that's the trigger for plasticity,

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:41.760
but the real secret is
that neuroplasticity

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.460
doesn't occur during wakefulness.

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:46.560
It occurs during sleep.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.560
We now know that if you
focus very hard on something

01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:54.060
for about 90 minutes or so,

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.150
maybe you even do several
bouts of that per day.

01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:58.630
If you can do that, some people can,

01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:01.970
some people can only do one
focus about of learning,

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.810
that night and the following
nights, while you're asleep

01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:07.760
the neural circuits that
were highlighted if you will

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.640
with acetylcholine
transmission will strengthen

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.760
and other will be lost,

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.800
which is wonderful because
that's the essence of plasticity.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.540
And what it means is that
when you eventually wake up

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.750
a couple of days or a week later,

01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:22.550
you will will have acquired
the knowledge forever

01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:24.827
unless you go through some
process to actively unlearn it.

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:27.733
And we will talk about
unlearning in a later episode.

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:30.870
So mastering sleep is key

01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:32.930
in order to reinforce
the learning that occurs.

01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:35.240
But let's say you get a
really poor night of sleep

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.010
after a about of learning.

01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:39.450
Chances are, if you sleep the next night

01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:42.630
or the following night
that learning will occur.

01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:44.010
There's a stamp in the brain

01:14:44.010 --> 01:14:45.620
where this acetylcholine was released.

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.580
It actually marks those
synapses neurochemically

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:51.290
and metabolically, so
that those are synopses

01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:52.920
are more biased to change.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.160
Now, if you don't ever get that deep sleep

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.453
then you probably won't get those changes.

01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:01.610
There's also a way in which
you can bypass the need

01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:04.310
for deep sleep at least
partially by engaging

01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:08.470
in what I call Non Sleep Deep
Rest, these NSDR protocols.

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:09.910
But I just want to
discuss the signs of this.

01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:13.040
There was a paper that was
published in Cell Reports

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.150
last year that shows that if people did,

01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:18.700
it was a spatial memory task,
actually quite difficult one

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.380
where they had to remember
the sequence of lights

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:21.437
lighting up and if they're
just two or three lights

01:15:21.437 --> 01:15:24.170
in a particular sequence it's easy

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:26.900
but as you get up to 15 or 16 lights

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.880
and numbers in the sequence

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.930
it actually gets quite challenging.

01:15:30.930 --> 01:15:33.150
If immediately after,

01:15:33.150 --> 01:15:35.090
and it was immediately after the learning

01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:37.080
the actual performance of this task,

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:42.080
people took a 20 minute Non
Sleep Deep Rest protocol

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.940
or took a shallow nap, so lying down,

01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:47.630
feet slightly elevated perhaps,

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:50.410
just closing their eyes, no sensory input,

01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:52.890
the rates of learning
were significantly higher

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:56.440
for that information than
where the two just had

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.260
a good night's sleep the following night.

01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.890
So you can actually accelerate learning

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:02.480
with these NSDR protocols
or with brief naps,

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.250
90 minutes or less.

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:09.050
So the key to plasticity in
childhood is to be a child.

01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:13.320
The key to plasticity in
adulthood is to engage alertness,

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:18.190
engage focus and then to
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest

01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:22.800
and deep sleep while you're in
your typical about of sleep.

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:23.907
I always get asked,

01:16:23.907 --> 01:16:26.410
"How many bouts of
learning can I perform?"

01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:28.980
Well, I know people that train up

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:32.520
these visual focus mechanisms
to the point where they can do

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.360
several 90 minute bouts
throughout the day,

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.800
as many as three or four.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.130
And some of them are also inserting

01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:40.200
Non Sleep Deep Rest as well.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.560
Now that can get pretty tricky.

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.080
A lot of people find that
they can recover best

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:48.890
from these intense bouts
of focused learning

01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:51.590
by doing some motor activity

01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:53.950
where you get into
self-generated optic flow.

01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:55.170
And that should make sense

01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:56.870
if you've ever heard
me lecture about stress

01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:59.090
which I've done a little
bit in various podcasts.

01:16:59.090 --> 01:17:01.400
When we are in a mode of
self-generated optic flow

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.920
like walking or running or cycling

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.730
and things are just floating
past us on our retina,

01:17:06.730 --> 01:17:08.300
we're not really looking
anywhere in particular,

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:11.030
so this is the opposite of
a tight window of focus.

01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:12.700
When we do that,

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.740
there are areas of the
brain like the amygdala

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.650
which are involved in releasing epinephrin

01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:18.840
and create alertness.

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.650
At the extremes, it creates
fear but certainly alertness,

01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:22.880
those are all shut down.

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.960
So it's its own form
of non sleep deep rest.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:29.640
So some people find it much
more pleasurable and practical

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:33.360
to engage in a focused about of learning

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.910
and then go do some activity that involves

01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:38.510
what we would essentially
call worldlessness

01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:40.220
where you're not really
thinking about much of anything.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.290
And so for those of you that listen

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:43.500
to audio books or podcasts while you run

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.760
you may want to consider whether or not

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.400
that's how you want to
spend your time right now.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.060
I'd love it if you were
listening to this podcast

01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:52.380
while you run or cycle, but
I'm much more interested

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:55.300
in you actually getting the
benefits of neuroplasticity

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:58.140
than just listening to me for
the sake of listening to me.

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:02.580
So for many people letting the mind drift

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:04.760
where it's not organized in thought

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:07.420
after a period of very
deliberate focused effort

01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:09.250
is the best way to accelerate learning

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:10.110
and depth of learning.

01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:11.320
And there are good scientific data

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.540
to support these sorts of things,

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:14.180
including the Cell Reports paper

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:16.340
that I mentioned a few moments ago.

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.230
I want to synthesize
some of the information

01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:20.500
that we've covered up until now.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:23.230
This entire month is
about neuroplasticity.

01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:25.600
Today's episode has covered a lot,

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.280
but by no means has it
covered all of the potential

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.500
for neuroplasticity and
protocols for plasticity.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.270
We will get into all of it.

01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:37.560
But today I want to make
sure that these key elements

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.060
that form the backbone of neuroplasticity

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.580
are really embedded in people's minds.

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:45.533
First of all, plasticity
occurs throughout the lifespan.

01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:49.630
Early, from birth until 25,

01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:54.330
mere exposure to a sensory
event can create plasticity.

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.600
That could be a good thing or a bad thing.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.720
We're going to talk about
unlearning the bad stuff,

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.333
traumas, et cetera in a
subsequent episode this month.

01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:08.920
If you want to learn as an
adult, you have to be alert.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.160
It might seem so obvious

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:12.690
but I think a lot of
people don't think about

01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:15.913
when in their 24 hour
cycle, they're most alert.

01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:21.330
There are four episodes
devoted to that 24-hour cycle

01:19:21.330 --> 01:19:23.000
and the cycles of alertness and sleep.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.140
I encourage you to listen to those

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:27.070
if you haven't had the opportunity to yet

01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:30.020
or just ask yourself when
during the day do you typically

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.230
tend to be most alert?

01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:33.970
That will afford you an advantage

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:36.950
in learning specific things
during that period of time.

01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:38.720
So don't give up that period of time

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.280
for things that are meaningless, useless,

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.040
or not aligned with your goals.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.260
That'd be a terrible time to
get into passive observance

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:51.260
or just letting your time
get soaked away by something.

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.600
That is a valuable asset, that epinephrin,

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.840
released from your brainstem
is going to occur more readily

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:02.580
at particular phases of your
24-hour cycle than others,

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:05.370
during the waking phase of course.

01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:07.650
You should know when those are.

01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:10.220
And then you could start to think about

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:13.190
the behavioral practices, maybe
the pharmacologic practices

01:20:13.190 --> 01:20:15.030
like caffeine, hydration, et cetera

01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:19.180
that will support heightened
levels of alertness.

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.930
Attention is something that can be learned

01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:25.300
and attention is critical
for creating that condition

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:28.250
where whatever it is
that you are engaging in

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:31.450
will modify your brain in a way

01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:34.330
that you won't have to spend
so much attention on it

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.163
going forward.

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:36.290
That's the essence of plasticity,

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:38.100
that things will eventually
become reflexive.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.640
The language that you're learning,

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.480
the motor movement, the cognitive skill,

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:44.530
the ability to suppress
an emotional response

01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:46.240
or to engage in emotional response

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.417
depending on what your goals are

01:20:47.417 --> 01:20:49.003
and what's appropriate for you.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.710
Increasing acetylcholine
can be accomplished

01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:54.760
pharmacologically through nicotine.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.050
However, there are certain dangers

01:20:57.050 --> 01:21:00.830
for many people to do
that as well as the cost,

01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:01.893
financial cost,

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.620
learning how to engage
the cholinergic system

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.100
through the use of the visual system,

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:10.030
practicing how long can you maintain focus

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:12.133
with blinks as you need them,

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.980
but how long can you maintain
visual focus on a target,

01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:20.290
just on a piece of paper set
a few feet away in the room

01:21:20.290 --> 01:21:22.020
or at the level of your computer screen.

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:24.490
These are actually things
that people do in communities

01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:27.600
where high levels of
visual focus are necessary.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.570
Now, the other way to get
high levels of visual focus

01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:31.260
and alertness is to have a panic

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:33.930
or to have a situation
that's very, very bad.

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:36.020
You will be immediately
focused on everything

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:39.650
related to that situation,
but that's unfortunate.

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:41.720
What we're really talking
about here is trying to

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:43.540
harness the mechanisms of attention

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:45.580
and get better at paying attention.

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.250
You may want to do that
with your auditory system,

01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:48.930
not with your visual system,

01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:51.310
either because you're
low vision or no vision,

01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:52.680
or because you're trying
to learn something

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.650
that relates more to sounds
than to what you see.

01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:57.250
But for most people they're
trying to learn information,

01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:59.400
cognitive information, or
they're trying to learn how to

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:02.970
hear the nuance in their
partner's explanations

01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:05.830
of their emotionally
challenging events, et cetera.

01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:08.080
And just remember, by the
way, what I said earlier,

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.220
which is that if you really
want somebody to listen to you

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:14.510
and really hear what you're
saying and what's underlying it,

01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:16.770
you should not, and cannot expect them

01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:18.360
to look directly at you while you do that.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.650
That's actually going to
limit their ability to focus.

01:22:20.650 --> 01:22:22.210
I'm trying to rescue a few folks out there

01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:24.360
who might be in this struggle.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.563
I of course have never
been in this struggle.

01:22:28.231 --> 01:22:30.450
And that was supposed to be a joke.

01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:32.970
I'm very familiar with that struggle

01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:35.470
but I know that one can
get better at listening,

01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:37.210
one can get better at learning,

01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:39.014
one can get better at all sorts

01:22:39.014 --> 01:22:42.110
of things by anchoring
in these mechanisms.

01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:44.640
Now, of course you can
also combine protocols.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:48.430
You can decide to combine pharmacology

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.710
with these learning practices.

01:22:50.710 --> 01:22:53.360
Many people in communities do that.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.080
Many people are doing that naturally

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.110
by drinking their coffee

01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:58.280
right before they do their learning.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.670
But I would also encourage
you to think about

01:23:00.670 --> 01:23:02.210
how long those learning bouts are.

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:06.810
If you think you have ADD or ADHD,

01:23:06.810 --> 01:23:09.280
see a clinician but you
should also ask yourself

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.240
are you giving up the best period of focus

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.090
that you have each day naturally

01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:16.430
to some other thing like social media

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:19.100
or some other activity
that doesn't serve you well

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:22.913
or are you devoting that period
to the opportunity to learn?

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.720
You should also ask
yourself whether or not

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:29.393
you're trying to focus too much
for too long during the day.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.360
I know some very high
performing individuals,

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.090
very high-performing in
a variety of contexts

01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:37.980
and none of them are focused all day long.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.180
Many of them take walks down the hallway,

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:41.200
sometimes mumbling to themselves,

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.960
they're not paying
attention to anything else.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.120
They go for bike rides, they take walks.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.410
They are not trying to engage their mind

01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:49.880
at maximum focus all the time.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:53.340
Very few people do that
because we learn best

01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.630
in these 90 minute bouts

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:56.680
inside of one of these ultradian cycles.

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:59.800
And I should repeat again, that
within that 90-minute cycle,

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.360
you should not expect yourself to focus

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.069
for the entire period
of one 90-minute cycle.

01:24:03.069 --> 01:24:05.270
The beginning and end are
going to be a little bit

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:06.850
flickering in and out of focus.

01:24:06.850 --> 01:24:09.060
How do you know when one
of these 90-minute cycles

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.410
is starting, or typically when you wake up

01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:13.130
os the beginning of the
first 90-minute cycle,

01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:14.820
but it's not down to the minute.

01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:17.140
You'll be able to tap into your sense

01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:18.240
of these 90-minute cycles

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.890
as you start to engage in
these learning practices

01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:22.440
should you choose.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.850
And then of course getting
some non sleep deep rest

01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:27.060
or just deliberate disengagement,

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.070
such as walking or running,

01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:33.360
or just sitting, eyes closed or eyes open

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.550
you kind of mindlessly
it might seem in a chair,

01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:36.910
just letting your thoughts move around

01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:39.580
after a learning about will accelerate

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:40.760
the rate of plasticity

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:43.513
that's been shown in quality
peer reviewed studies.

01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:46.750
And then of course, deep sleep.

01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:49.920
And so what we can start to see is that

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:54.920
plasticity is your natural
right early in life.

01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:57.860
But after about age 25

01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:00.470
you have to do some work
in order to access it.

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:03.300
But fortunately, these
beautiful experiments

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:06.380
of Hubel and Wiesel and Merzenich
and Weinberger and others

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:09.020
point in the direction of what allows us

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:10.230
to achieve plasticity,

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:12.660
it points to the neurochemicals
and the circuits.

01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:14.840
And we now have behavioral protocols

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.090
that allow us to do that.

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.740
I also really want to emphasize

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:23.770
that there's an entire other
aspect of behavioral practices

01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:26.270
that will allow us to engage in plasticity

01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:29.930
that don't involve intense
focus on emotionality

01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:32.650
but involve a lot of repetition.

01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:35.950
So there's another entire
category of plasticity

01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:40.150
that involves doing what seemed
like almost mundane things

01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:44.170
but doing them over and
over again repeatedly

01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:47.180
and incorporating the reward
system that involves dopamine.

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:49.180
So today I talked about
the kind of plasticity

01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:50.770
that comes from extreme focus.

01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:53.004
You would get that extreme
focus and alertness naturally

01:25:53.004 --> 01:25:56.320
through a harder, difficult
event that you didn't want.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.530
That's the kind of stinger

01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:59.150
but your brain is
designed to keep you safe

01:25:59.150 --> 01:26:01.220
so it wants to get one trial learning

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:03.020
from things like touching a hot stove

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.413
or engaging with a really horrible person.

01:26:08.010 --> 01:26:12.430
You can get incredible plasticity
of positive experiences

01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:16.020
of things that you want by
engaging this high focus regime

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:18.453
and then rest, non sleep
deep rest, and sleep.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.403
And there's another aspect of plasticity

01:26:21.403 --> 01:26:24.430
which we will explore next episode

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:28.010
as well as when we explore
movement-based practices

01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:32.520
for enhancing plasticity and
plasticity of movement itself.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.890
And those are not of the high attention

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:37.580
kind of high emotionality

01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:41.170
or in the intensity of the experiences

01:26:41.170 --> 01:26:42.390
that I described today.

01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:45.980
Those are more about repetition
and reward and repeat,

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.650
repetition, reward, repeat,

01:26:47.650 --> 01:26:51.420
and they are used for a
distinctly different category

01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:54.690
of behavioral change more
of which relate to habits

01:26:54.690 --> 01:26:58.750
as opposed to learning of
particular types of information

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:03.330
that allow us to perform physically,

01:27:03.330 --> 01:27:06.620
cognitively or adjust
our emotional system.

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:07.460
So I'm going to stop there.

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.740
I'm sure there are a lot of questions.

01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.960
Please put your questions
in the comment section below

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.950
and please remember that this entire month

01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:16.120
we're going to be
exploring neuroplasticity.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.490
So this discussion/lecture,

01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:21.950
I wish it was more of a back and forth,

01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:24.670
but this is what the format offers us.

01:27:24.670 --> 01:27:27.400
So please do put your questions
in the comment section

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.500
and I will address them in
the other episodes coming soon

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.460
on neuroplasticity.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.260
As I say that I'm reminded

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:38.700
that many of you are listening
to this on Apple or Spotify

01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.370
and therefore there isn't an opportunity

01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:44.810
to leave comments aside from
the rating section on Apple.

01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:48.360
So if you have specific topics
related to neuroplasticity

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.700
that you would like me to cover

01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.840
in the subsequent episodes this month

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.710
please go to the YouTube, subscribe,

01:27:54.710 --> 01:27:58.070
but as well please put your
question in the comment section

01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:01.720
for this episode and I'll be
sure to read them and respond.

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.570
Many of you have very graciously asked

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:06.040
how you can help support
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:10.340
Best way to do that is
to subscribe on YouTube.

01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:12.500
You might want to also hit
the notification button

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:15.460
so that you don't miss
any upcoming episodes.

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:16.690
Leave a comment,

01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:20.180
as well if you go to Apple,
you can give us a 5-star rating

01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:21.890
and there's a place there where also

01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:23.230
you can leave a comment.

01:28:23.230 --> 01:28:24.950
And if you prefer to listen on Spotify

01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:27.450
subscribe and download on Spotify.

01:28:27.450 --> 01:28:29.080
In addition, it's always helpful

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.690
if you recommend the podcast
to your friends and family

01:28:31.690 --> 01:28:35.000
and others who you think might
benefit from the information

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.030
and as well, please
check out our sponsors.

01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:40.060
That's a great way to help us.

01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:42.170
Today and in previous episodes,

01:28:42.170 --> 01:28:44.710
I've talked a number of
times about supplements.

01:28:44.710 --> 01:28:47.210
I'm very pleased that we're
partnering with Thorne,

01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:49.860
T-h-o-r-n-e supplements

01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:53.170
because Thorne has the very
high levels of stringency

01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:56.210
in terms of product quality and precision

01:28:56.210 --> 01:28:59.930
about how much of given
supplements are in the bottle

01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:02.670
which is vital and not
all supplement companies

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.360
have stood up to the test on that one.

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.440
If you want to check out Thorne

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:12.440
and go to Thorne that's
thorne.com/u/huberman.

01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:16.520
And if you do that, you'll get 20% off

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.480
any supplements that you purchase.

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.650
I've also listed there
a gallery of supplements

01:29:20.650 --> 01:29:23.330
that I take, including
magnesium glycinate.

01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:24.870
I know in previous episodes,

01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:27.020
I talked about magnesium threonate

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:28.850
as a sleep aid that I take.

01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:31.580
magnesium glycinate
and magnesium threonate

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.880
are essentially interchangeable.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.330
Thanks so much for your
time and attention,

01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:37.840
and as always thank you for
your interest in science.
