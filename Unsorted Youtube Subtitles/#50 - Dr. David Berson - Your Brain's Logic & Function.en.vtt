00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.910
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.763
for everyday life.

00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:08.274
[upbeat music]

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.770
I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm
a Professor of Neurobiology

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.960
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.220
Today my guest is Dr. David Berson,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.470
Professor of Medical Science,
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.290
at Brown University.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.758
Dr. Berson's laboratory is credited

00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:26.010
with discovering the cells in the eye

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.802
that set your circadian rhythms.

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:30.120
These are the so-called intrinsically

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.060
photosensitive melanopsin cells.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.750
And while that's a mouthful,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.051
all you need to know for sake
of this introduction is that,

00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:38.810
those are the cells that
inform your brain and body

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.610
about the time of day.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.153
Dr. Berson's laboratory has also made

00:00:42.153 --> 00:00:44.270
a number of other important discoveries

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.910
about how we convert our
perceptions of the outside world

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.110
into motor action.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.290
More personally, Dr. Berson
has been my go-to resource

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.230
for all things neuroscience
for nearly two decades.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.220
I knew of his reputation
as a spectacular researcher

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.710
for a long period of time.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.110
And then many years ago, I cold
called him out of the blue,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.260
I basically corralled him
into a long conversation

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.960
over the phone after which
he invited me out to Brown

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.050
and we've been discussing neuroscience

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.750
and how the brain works and
the emerging new technologies

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.500
and the emerging new
concepts in neuroscience

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.050
for a very long time now.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.130
You're going to realize today

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.640
why Dr. Berson is my go-to source.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.300
He has an exceptionally
clear and organized view

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.390
of how the nervous system works.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.580
There are many many parts
of the nervous system,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.460
different nuclei and connections
and circuits and chemicals

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.210
and so forth, but it takes
a special kind of person

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.330
to be able to organize that
information into a structured

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.760
and logical framework that
can allow us to make sense

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.220
of how we function in
terms of what we feel,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.070
what we experience, how
we move through the world.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.090
Dr. Berson is truly one
of a kind in his ability

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.410
to synthesize and organize and
communicate that information.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.150
And I give him credit
as one of my mentors,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.300
and one of the people that I respect most

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.270
in the field of science and
medical science generally.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.620
Today Dr. Berson takes us on a journey

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.360
from the periphery of the nervous system,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.240
meaning from the outside,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.070
deep into the nervous
system layer by layer,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.394
structure by structure, circuit by circuit

00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:17.910
making clear to us

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.050
how each of these individual circuits work

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.470
and how they work together as a whole.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.530
It's a really magnificent description

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.470
that you simply cannot
get from any textbook,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.310
from any popular book and
frankly, as far as I know,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.160
from any podcast that
currently exists out there.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.920
So it's a real gift to
have this opportunity

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.203
to learn from Dr. Berson.

00:02:36.203 --> 00:02:40.000
Again, I consider him my
mentor in the field of learning

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.480
and teaching neuroscience,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.810
and I'm excited for you to learn from him.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.720
One thing is for certain,
by the end of this podcast,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.590
you will know far more about
how your nervous system works

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.303
than the vast majority of people out there

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:55.360
including many expert
biologists and neuroscientists.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.040
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.980
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.920
It is however part of my desire and effort

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.500
to bring zero-cost to consumer
information about science,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.250
and science-related tools
to the general public.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.270
In keeping with that theme,

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.705
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:14.290
Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.900
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.320
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.540
I've been taking Athletic
Greens every day since 2012.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.940
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.750
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.502
and the reason I still take
Athletic Greens is that,

00:03:27.502 --> 00:03:31.520
it covers all of my vitamin
mineral and probiotic needs.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.610
Nowadays there's a lot of data out there

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.280
pointing to the fact that
a healthy gut microbiome

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.310
literally, little microbes
that live in our gut,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.750
that are good for us
is important to support

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.660
our immune system, our nervous
system, our endocrine system,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.540
and various aspects of our
immediate and long-term health.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.250
With Athletic Greens I get
all the vitamins and minerals

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.720
that I need plus the probiotics

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.580
ensure a healthy gut microbiome.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.990
It also tastes really good, I
mix mine up with some water,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.270
a little bit of lemon juice,
I'll have that early in the day

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.770
and sometimes a second time
later in the day as well.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.305
It's compatible with intermittent fasting,

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:05.990
it's compatible with vegan
diets, with keto diets,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.230
and essentially every diet

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.529
that you could possibly imagine out there.

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.210
It's also filled with
adaptogens for recovery,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.070
it has digestive enzymes for gut health,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.140
and has a number of other things

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.690
that support the immune system.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.930
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.470
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.990
to claim their special offer.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.490
They'll give you five free travel packs

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.360
that make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.480
while you're on the road,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.130
and they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3K2.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.830
There's now a lot of
evidence that vitamin D3

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.550
supports a huge number
of metabolic factors,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.365
immune system factors, endocrine factors,

00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:41.380
basically, we need vitamin D3,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.720
we can get it from the sun,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.230
but many people are
deficient in vitamin D3

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.430
even if they are getting

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.330
what they think is sufficient sunlight.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.760
And K2 is important for
cardiovascular health.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.650
So again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.180
you can claim their special offer,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.360
the five free travel packs,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.210
plus the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.229
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.566
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:05:04.566 --> 00:05:07.330
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.850
to help you better understand your body

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.760
and help you reach your health goals.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.690
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.967
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:18.229
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.120
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.620
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.220
you can also get information
about how your specific genes

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.770
are impacting your immediate
and long-term health.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.260
Now a problem with a lot of blood tests

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.730
and DNA tests out there,
is you get the numbers back

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.750
but you don't know what
to do with those numbers,

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.050
with InsideTracker they make
it very simple to figure out

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.370
what to do to bring those
numbers into the ranges

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.610
that are right for you.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.340
They have a dashboard
that's very easy to use,

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.810
you can see the numbers from
your blood and/or DNA tests,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.788
and it will point to
specific lifestyle factors,

00:05:49.788 --> 00:05:53.300
nutritional factors as
well as supplementation

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.960
maybe even prescription factors
that would be right for you

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.980
to bring the numbers
into range that are ideal

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.400
for your immediate and
long-term health goals.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.761
Another feature the InsideTracker has

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.960
is their inner age test.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.240
This test shows you what
your biological age is

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.530
and compares that to
your chronological age

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.260
and what you can do to
improve your biological age,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.130
which of course is the important number.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.510
If you'd like to try InsideTracker

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.120
you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.090
to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.410
Also an interview I did with
Longevity Research Doctor

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.523
and InsideTracker's
Founder Dr. Gil Blander,

00:06:25.523 --> 00:06:29.600
is out now on their podcast,
the longevity by design podcast

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.750
and a link to that interview

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.850
can be found in today's show notes.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.960
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Magic Spoon.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.490
Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.180
keto-friendly cereal.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.920
I don't follow a ketogenic diet.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.840
The way that I eat is basically geared

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.130
toward feeling alert
when I want to be alert

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.040
and feeling sleepy when
I want to go to sleep.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.660
Which for me means fasting
until about 11:00 am or noon

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.970
most days, then I eat
low carb during the day.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.620
So I'll have some meat or
fish or chicken and some salad

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.330
that's what works for
me, and in the afternoon,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.070
I remain on a more or
less low carb-ish diet,

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.687
and then in the evening, I eat
pastas and things primarily

00:07:03.687 --> 00:07:05.440
and I throttle back on the protein

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.170
and that's what allows me
to fall asleep at night.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.720
That's just what works for me.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.790
So if I want a snack in the afternoon,

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.100
I want that to be a
ketogenic or low carb snack

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.860
and that snack these days is Magic Spoon.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.510
Magic Spoon is really terrific,
it has zero grams of sugar,

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.150
13 to 14 grams of protein,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.250
and only four net grams of
carbohydrates in each serving.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.160
It's really delicious,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.240
they have a number of
different flavors like cocoa,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.340
fruity, peanut butter and frosted,

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.130
I particularly like frosted.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.280
It tastes like donuts
and I really like donuts

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.580
although I try not to eat
donuts too often if ever.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.610
What I do lately, is I take Magic Spoon,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.990
I put it in some Bulgarian
yogurt which is really good

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.923
and I mix that up, I put those in there

00:07:41.923 --> 00:07:44.030
and sometimes I put some cinnamon on them.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.900
And as I'm describing this,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.210
I'm getting hungry for Magic Spoon.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.990

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.040
And now for my discussion with
Dr. David Berson, welcome.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.000
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.160
- So nice to be here.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.223
- Great to have you.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.170
For more than 20 years
you've been my go-to source

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.920
for all things, nervous
system how it works,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.140
how it's structured.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.160
So today I want to ask you
some questions about that.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.880
I think people would gain a lot
of insight into this machine

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.203
that makes them think and
feel and see, et cetera.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.333
If you would, could
you tell us how we see?

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.510
A photon of light enters
the eye, what happens?

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.343
- Right.

00:08:38.343 --> 00:08:41.350
- How is it that I look
outside, I see a truck drive by,

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.463
or I look on the wall I
see a photo of my dog,

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.350
how does that work?

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.130
- Right, so this is an
old question obviously.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.930
And clearly in the end,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.830
the reason you have a visual experience

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.160
is that your brain is got
some pattern of activity

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.140
that associates with the
input from the periphery.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.790
But you can have a visual experience

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.590
with no input from the periphery as well.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.050
When you're dreaming, you're seeing things

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.490
that aren't coming through your eyes.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.583
- Are those memories?

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.760
- I would say in a sense

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.180
they may reflect your visual experience

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.160
they're not necessarily
specific visual memories,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.770
but of course they can be.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.910
But the point is, that
the experience of seeing

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.423
is actually a brain phenomenon.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.550
But of course, under normal circumstances,

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.510
we see the world because
we're looking at it

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.540
and we're using our eyes to look at it.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.290
And fundamentally, when we're
looking at the exterior world,

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.070
it's what the retina is
telling the brain that matters.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.900
So there are cells called ganglion cells,

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.210
these are neurons that are the
key cells for communicating

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.450
between eye and brain, the
eye is like the camera,

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.460
it's detecting the initial image,

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.700
doing some initial processing,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.530
and then that signal gets
sent back to the brain proper

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.360
and of course, it's there
at the level of the cortex

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.250
that we have this conscious
visual experience.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.433
There are many other places in the brain

00:09:57.433 --> 00:10:00.940
that get visual input as
well doing other things

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.790
with that kind of information.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.010
- So I get a lot of
questions about color vision.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.360
If you would, could you explain

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.350
how is it that we can perceive
reds and greens and blues

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.490
and things of that sort.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.430
- Right, so the first thing
to understand about light,

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.923
is that it's just a form of
electromagnetic radiation,

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.620
it's vibrating, it's oscillating, but.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.580
- When you say it's
vibrating, it's oscillating,

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.500
you mean that photons are actually moving?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.660
- Well in a sense, photons
they're certainly moving

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.470
through space, we think
about photons as particles

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.070
and that's one way of
thinking about light,

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.230
but we can also think of it
as a wave like a radio wave,

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.890
either way is acceptable.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.600
And the radio waves have frequencies

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.280
like the frequencies
on the your radio dial,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.094
and certain frequencies in
the electromagnetic spectrum

00:10:48.094 --> 00:10:51.000
can be detected by neurons in the retina,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.980
those are the things we see,

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.390
but there's still different
wavelengths within the light

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.800
that can be seen by the eye.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.540
And those different wavelengths
are unpacked in a sense

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.570
or decoded by the nervous system

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.423
to lead to our experience of color.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.540
Essentially, different
wavelengths give us the sensation

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.700
of different colors through the auspices

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.900
of different neurons that are tuned

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.700
to different wavelengths of light.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.240
- So when a photon, so
when a little bit of light

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.800
hits my eye goes in,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.470
the photoreceptors convert
that into electrical signal?

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.303
- Right.

00:11:27.303 --> 00:11:30.700
- How is it that a given photon of light

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.410
gives me the perception eventually,

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.200
leads the perception of red
versus green versus blue?

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.030
- Right, so if you imagine
that in the first layer

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.310
of the retina where this
transformation occurs

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.577
from electromagnetic
radiation into neural signals

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.740
that you have different
kinds of sensitive cells

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.020
that are expressing, they're
making different molecules

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.480
within themselves for this express purpose

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.360
of absorbing photons
which is the first step

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.565
in the process of seeing, now
it turns out that altogether,

00:12:03.565 --> 00:12:06.700
there are about five proteins like this

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.344
that we need to think about
in the typical retina,

00:12:09.344 --> 00:12:11.890
but for seeing color
really it's three of them.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.340
So they're three different proteins,

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.590
each absorbs light with a
different preferred frequency,

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.540
and then the nervous system
keeps track of those signals

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.730
compares and contrasts them
to extract some understanding

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.110
of the wavelength composition of light.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.650
So you can see just by
looking at a landscape,

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.390
or it must be late in the day

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.990
because things are looking golden

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.570
that's all a function of
our absorbing the light

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.695
that's coming from the world

00:12:39.695 --> 00:12:41.700
and interpreting that with our brain

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.540
because of the different
composition of the light

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.709
that's reaching our eyes.

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:48.210
- Is it fair to assume
that my perception of red

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.230
is the same as your perception of red?

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.207
- Well, that's a great question.

00:12:51.207 --> 00:12:52.583
- And that mine is better?

00:12:53.959 --> 00:12:54.792
I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

00:12:54.792 --> 00:12:55.625
[laughs]

00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:57.600
- It's a great question, it's
a deep philosophical question.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.960
It's a question that really
probably can't even ultimately

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.960
be answered by the usual
empirical scientific processes,

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.413
'cause it's really about
an individual's experience.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.340
What we can say is that
the biological mechanisms

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.450
that we think are important
for seeing color for example,

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.520
seem to be very highly similar

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.040
from one individual to the next
whether it be human beings,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.053
or other animals.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.510
And so we think that the
physiological process

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.780
looks very similar on the front end,

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.117
but once you're at the level
of perception or understanding

00:13:33.117 --> 00:13:37.670
or experience, that's something
that's a little bit tougher

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:42.570
to nail down with the sorts
of scientific approaches

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.090
that we approach biological
vision let's say.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.060
- You mentioned that there
are five different cone types

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.640
essentially, the cones being
the cells that absorb light

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.890
of different wavelengths.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.450
I often wondered when I had my dog,

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.930
what he saw and how his vision
differs from our vision.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.220
And certainly, there are
animals that can see things

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.120
that we can't see.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:05.953
- Right?

00:14:05.953 --> 00:14:08.581
- What are some of the more
outrageous examples of that?

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:09.786
- I've seen things.

00:14:09.786 --> 00:14:12.220
- And same things in the extreme.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.550
- Right.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.580
- Dogs I'm guessing see reds
more as oranges, is that right?

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.340
'Cause they don't have the
same array of of neurons

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.920
that we have for seeing color.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.580
- Right, so the first thing is,

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.970
it's not really five types of colons,

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.840
there are really three types of colons.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.160
And if you look at the
way that color vision

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.740
is thought to work, you can sort of see

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.120
that it has to be three different signals.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.300
There are a couple of
other types of pigments.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.660
One is really mostly for dim light vision.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.800
When you're walking
around in a moonless night

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.730
and you're seeing things
with very low light

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.220
that's the rod cell that
uses its own pigment.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.370
And then there's another class of pigments

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:52.960
we'll probably talk
about a little bit later,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.390
this melanopsin pigment.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.260
- I thought you were
referring to like ultraviolet

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.500
and infrared and things like that.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.670
- Right, so in the case of a typical,

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.880
well, let's put it this way.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.540
In human beings, most of
us have three cone types

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.840
and we can see colors that stem from that.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.840
In most mammals including
your dog or your cat,

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.530
there really are only two cone types

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.840
and that limits the kind of
vision that they can have

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.080
in the domain of wavelength
or color as you would say.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.860
So really, a dog sees the
world kind of like a particular

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.730
kind of color blind human
might see the world,

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.770
because instead of having
three channels to compare

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.760
and contrast they only have two channels

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.050
and that makes it much more
difficult to figure out exactly

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.140
which wavelength you're looking at.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.100
- Do colorblind people
suffer much as a consequence

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.470
of being colorblind?

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.523
- Well, it's like so
many other disabilities.

00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:54.003
The world is built for people
of the most common type.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.660
So in some cases, the
expectation can be there

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.000
that somebody can see something
that they won't be able to

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.450
if they're missing one of
their cone types let's say.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.663
So in those moments, that
can be a real problem.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.510
If there's a lack of contrast
to their visual system,

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.010
they will be blind to that.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:18.347
In general, it's a fairly
modest visual limitation

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:20.650
as things go.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.010
For example, if not
being able to see acutely

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.170
can be much more damaging,

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.542
not being able to read
fine print for example.

00:16:26.542 --> 00:16:28.392
- Yeah, I suppose if I had to give up

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.650
the ability to see certain colors

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.370
or give up the ability to see clearly,

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.530
I could certainly trade
out color for clarity.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.734
- Right, of course, color
is very meaningful to us

00:16:39.734 --> 00:16:43.920
as human beings, so we
would hate to give it up.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.580
But obviously, dogs and cats
and all kinds of other mammals

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.110
do perfectly well in the world.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.270
- Yeah, because we take care of them.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.670
I spent most of my time
taking care of that dog.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.400
- He took care of me too.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.407
Let's talk about that odd photopigment.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.550
Photopigment of course being
the thing that absorbs light

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.100
of a particular wavelength,

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.120
and let's talk about these
specialized ganglion cells

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.410
that communicate certain
types of information

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.293
from eye to the brain
that are so important

00:17:15.293 --> 00:17:16.700
for so many things.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.460
What I'm referring to here of course is,

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.150
your co-discovery of the so-called

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.310
intrinsically photosensitive cells,

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.060
the neurons in the eye that
do so many of the things

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.610
that don't actually have
to do with perception,

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:30.290
but have to do with important
biological functions.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.210
What I would love for you to do

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.110
is explain to me why once I heard you say

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.670
we have a bit of fly eye in our eye.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.190
- Yeah.
- And you showed this slide

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.460
of a giant fly from a horror movie.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.800
- Yeah.
- Trying to attack this woman.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.633
- Yeah.

00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:48.600
- And maybe it was an eye also.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.070
So what does it mean that
we have a bit of a fly eye

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.133
in our eye?

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:58.513
- Yeah, so this last pigment
is a really peculiar one.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.590
One can think about it

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.010
as really the initial
sensitive element in a system

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.350
that's designed to tell your brain

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.523
about how bright things are in your world.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.270
And the thing that's really
peculiar about this pigment,

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.450
is that it's in the
wrong place in a sense.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.600
When you think about the
structure of the retina,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.560
you think about a layer cake essentially.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.340
You've got this thin membrane
at the back of your eye,

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.830
but it's actually a stack of thin layers

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.470
and the outermost of those layers

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.740
is where these photoreceptors

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.500
you were talking about
earlier are sitting.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.440
That's where the film of
your camera is essentially,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.020
that's where the photons do their magic

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.160
with the photo pigments and
turn it into a neural signal.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:39.993
- I like that I've never really thought

00:18:39.993 --> 00:18:42.040
of the photoreceptors is
the film of the camera,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.930
but that makes sense.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.200
- Or like the sensitive chip
on CCD chip in your cell phone.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.120
It's the surface on which
the light pattern is imaged

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.250
by the optics of the eye,

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.220
and now you've got an array of sensors

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.340
that's capturing that information

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.090
and creating a bitmap essentially,

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.580
but now it's in neural signals

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.290
distributed across the
surface of the retina.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.043
So all of that was known to
be going on 150 years ago,

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.740
a couple of types of
photoreceptors cones and rods.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.400
If you look a little bit more closely,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.600
three types of cones, that's
where the transformation

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.480
from electromagnetic
radiation to neural signals

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.520
was thought to take place.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.700
But it turns out that
this last photopigment

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.040
is in the other end of the retina,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.500
the innermost part of the retina,

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.540
that's where the so-called
ganglion cells are.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.150
Those are the cells
that talk to the brain,

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.870
the ones that actually
can communicate directly

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:38.240
what information comes to
them from the photoreceptors.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.150
And here you've got a case where actually,

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.772
some of the output neurons

00:19:42.772 --> 00:19:44.790
that we didn't think had any business

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.000
being directly sensitive to light

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.900
were actually making this
photopigment, absorbing light,

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.220
and converting that to neural signals

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.571
and sending it to the brain.

00:19:54.571 --> 00:19:58.640
So that made it pretty
surprising and unexpected,

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.800
but there are many surprising
things about these cells.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.240
- So, and what is the
relationship to the fly eye?

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.370
- Right, so the link there is,

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.640
that if you ask how the photopigment

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.360
now communicates downstream

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.960
from the initial absorption event

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.560
to get to the electrical signal,

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.283
that's a complex cellular process

00:20:19.283 --> 00:20:22.260
involves many chemical steps.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.630
And if you look at how
photoreceptors in our eyes work,

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.340
you can see what that cascade
is, how that chain works.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.222
If you look in the eyes
of flies or other insects

00:20:34.222 --> 00:20:36.670
or other invertebrates,

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.720
there's a very similar kind of chain.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.240
But the specifics of how the signals

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.600
get from the absorption
event by the pigment

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.860
to the electrical response

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.030
that the nervous system can understand,

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.910
are characteristically different

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.740
between fuzzy furry creatures like us

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.490
and insects for example like the fly.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.323
- I see.

00:20:57.323 --> 00:20:59.980
- So these funny extra photoreceptors

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.730
that are in the wrong layer

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.070
doing something completely different

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.760
are actually using a chemical cascade

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.310
that looks much more
like what you would see

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.120
in a fly photoreceptor,

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.900
than what you would see
in a human photoreceptor,

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.620
a rod or a cone for example.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:19.330
So it sounds like it's a very
primitive aspect of biology

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:20.410
that we maintain.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.130
- Exactly right, exactly.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.330
- And despite the fact that
dogs can't see as many colors

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.890
as we can and cats can't see
as many colors as we can,

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.810
we have all this extravagant
stuff for seeing color

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.610
and then you got this other pigment

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.720
sitting in the wrong not wrong,

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.000
but in a different part of the eye

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.820
sending processing light very differently.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.653
- Right.

00:21:40.653 --> 00:21:42.490
- And sending that
information into the brain.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.390
So, what do these cells do?

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.840
Presumably, they're there for a reason.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.910
- They are, and the
interesting thing is that,

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.370
one cell type like this
carrying one kind of signal

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.240
which I would call a
brightness signal essentially,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.150
can do many things in the brain.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.540
- When you say brightness
signal you mean that,

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.807
like right now, I have these
cells do I have these cells?

00:22:06.807 --> 00:22:07.640
Of course.
- You do.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.800
- I'm joking, I hope I
have these cells in my eye.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.800
And they're paying attention
to how bright it is overall,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.700
but they're not paying attention

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.990
for instance to the edge of area

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:16.800
or what else is going on in the room.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.500
- Right, so it's the difference

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.780
between knowing what the
objects are on the table

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.210
and knowing whether it's bright enough

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.860
to be daylight right now.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.000
So why does your nervous
system need to know

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.750
whether it's daylight right now?

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.010
Well, one thing that needs to know

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.030
that is your circadian clock.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.470
If you travel across time zones to Europe,

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.970
now your internal clock
thinks it's California time,

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.300
but the rotation of the earth

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.359
is for different part of the planet.

00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:47.880
The rising and setting of the sun

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.290
is not at all what your
body is anticipating.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.120
So you've got an internal representation

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.640
of the rotation of the
earth in your own brain,

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.680
that's your circadian
system it's keeping time.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.010
But now you've played a
trick on your nervous system,

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.110
you put yourself in a different place

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.680
where the sun is rising
at the quote wrong time.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.630
Well, that's not good for you, right?

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.980
So you got to get back on track.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.260
One of the things this system does,

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.980
is sends a oh, it's daylight
now signal to the brain,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.860
which compares with its internal clock.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.470
And if that's not right, it
tweaks the clock gradually

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:21.860
until you get over your jet lag

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.100
and you feel back on track again.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.970
- So the jet lag case
makes a lot of sense to me,

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:31.410
but presumably, these elements
didn't evolve for jet lag.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.243
- Right.

00:23:32.243 --> 00:23:35.870
- So, what are they doing
on a day-to-day basis?

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:38.710
- Right, well one way to
think about this is that,

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:42.980
the clock that you have
in not just your brain,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.670
in all the cells, almost all
of the cells of your body,

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.000
they're all oscillating, they're all.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.027
- They got local little clocks in them.

00:23:50.027 --> 00:23:51.290
- They got local little
clocks in themselves,

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.783
they're all clocks.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.823
They need to be
synchronized appropriately,

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.660
and the whole thing has to be
built in biological machinery.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:09.390
This is actually a beautiful
story about how gene expression

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.060
can control gene expression,
and if you set it up right,

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.470
you can set up a little thing
that just sort of hums along

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.575
at a particular frequency.

00:24:16.575 --> 00:24:19.320
In our case it's humming
along at 24 hours,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.050
'cause that's how our earth rotates

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.460
and it's all built into our biology.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.633
So this is great, but the reality is,

00:24:25.633 --> 00:24:28.040
that the clock can only be so good.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.600
I mean, we're talking about biology here.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.370
It's not precision engineering,

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.150
and so it can be a little bit off.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:35.920
- Well, also it's in our brain,

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.610
so it doesn't have access to
any regular unerring signal?

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.060
- Well, if in the absence of the rising

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.000
and setting of the sun it doesn't,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.560
if you put someone in a cave,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.830
their biological clock will keep time

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.870
to within a handful of
minutes of 24 hours,

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.010
that's no problem for one day.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.290
But if this went on
without any correction,

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.220
eventually you'd be out of phase

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.490
and this is actually one of the things

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.500
that blind patients often complain about.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.983
If they've got retinal
blindness is insomnia.

00:25:08.085 --> 00:25:10.100
[indistinct]

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.130
Exactly, they're not synchronized,
their clock is there,

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.730
but they're drifting out of phase

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:19.730
because their clock's only good
to 24.2 hours or 23.8 hours

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.120
little by little if they're drifting.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.030
So you need a synchronization signal.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.677
So even if you never across time zones

00:25:27.677 --> 00:25:29.680
and of course we didn't
back on the Savannah

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.593
we stayed within walking
distance of where we were,

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.310
you still need a synchronizer,
'cause otherwise,

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.130
you have nothing to actually confirm

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:41.580
when the rising and the
setting of the sun is,

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.360
that's what you're trying
to synchronize yourself to.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.120
- I'm fascinated by the circadian clock

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.100
and the fact that all
the cells of our body

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.340
have essentially a
24-hour-ish clock in them.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.450
- Right.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.160
- We hear a lot about
these circadian rhythms

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.180
and circadian clocks the
fact that we need light input

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.300
from these special neurons
in order to set the clock.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.310
But I've never really heard it described

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.490
how the clock itself works

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.190
and how the clock signals
to all the rest of the body

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.737
when the liver should be doing one thing

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.737
and the stomach should be doing another.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.190
I know you've done some work on the clock.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.610
So if you would just
maybe briefly describe

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.530
where the clock is, what it does,

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:28.510
and some of the top contour
of how it tells the cells

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.800
of the body what to do.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.890
- Right, so the first thing
to say is that, as you said,

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:34.650
the clock is all over the place.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.970
Most of the tissues in
your body have clocks.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.660
- We probably have what,
millions of clocks in our body.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.980
- Yeah, I would say that's probably fair.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.350
If you have millions of cell types,

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.050
you might have millions of clocks.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:50.240
The role of the central pacemaker
for the circadian system

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.770
is to coordinate all of these.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.900
And there's a little nucleus,

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.293
a little collection of
nerve cells in your brain

00:26:59.293 --> 00:27:02.137
it's called the suprachiasmatic
nucleus the SCN,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.770
and it is sitting in a funny place

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.373
for the rest of the structures
in the nervous system

00:27:07.373 --> 00:27:09.610
that get direct retinal input.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.990
It's sitting in the hypothalamus,

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.500
which you can think about as
sort of the great coordinator

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.480
of drives and.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.700
- The source of all our
pleasures and all our problems.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.130
- Right.
- Or most our problems.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:23.920
- Yes, it really is.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.220
But it's sort of deep in your brain

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.030
things that drive you to do things.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.116
If you're freezing cold, you
put on a coat, you shiver,

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:34.150
all these things are
coordinated by hypothalamus.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.560
So this pathway that we're
talking about from the retina

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.670
and from these peculiar cells

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.840
that are encoding light intensity,

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.430
are sending signals directly into a center

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.940
that's surrounded by all of these centers

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.040
that control autonomic nervous system

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.163
and your hormonal systems.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.230
So this is a part of your visual system

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.450
that doesn't really reach
the level of consciousness,

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.870
it's not something you think about,

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.060
it's happening under the
radar kind of all the time

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.480
and the signal is working its way

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.363
into this central clock
coordinating center.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:17.350
Now what happens then is
not that well understood,

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.980
but it's clear that
this is a neural center

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.730
that has the same ability to communicate

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.680
with other parts of your brain
as any other neural center.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.680
And clearly, there are circuits
that involve connections

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:34.070
between neurons that are conventional.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.330
But in addition, it's quite clear

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.490
that there are also
sort of humeral effects

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:41.929
that things are being oozing
out of the cells in the center

00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:43.900
and maybe into the circulation

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.640
or just diffusing through
the brain to some extent

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.650
that can also affect neurons elsewhere.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.770
But the hypothalamus uses everything

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.240
to control the rest of the body.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.630
And that's true, the supracosmetic nucleus

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.023
this circadian center as well,

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.078
it can get its fingers into
the autonomic nervous system,

00:29:03.078 --> 00:29:06.670
the humeral system and of
course, up to the centers

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:11.670
of the brain that organize
coordinated rational behavior.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.300
So if I understand correctly,

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.630
we have this group of cells,
the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.513
it's got a 24-hour rhythm,

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.580
that rhythm is more or less matched

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.840
to what's going on in our external world

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.460
by the specialized set
of neurons in our eye.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.490
But then the master clock itself the SCN,

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.050
releases things in the
blood humeral signals

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.830
that go out various places in the body.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.410
And you said to the autonomic system

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.150
which is regulating more or
less how alert or calm we are,

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.283
as well as our thinking and our cognition.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:49.260
So I'd love to talk to you
about the autonomic part,

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.250
presumably that's through melatonin,

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:57.250
it's through adrenaline
how is it that this clock

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.440
is impacting how the autonomic system,

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.100
how alert or calm we feel?

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.170
- Right, so there are pathways

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:09.330
by which the suprachiasmatic
nucleus can access

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.300
both the parasympathetic and
sympathetic nervous system.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.290
- Just so people know the
sympathetic nervous system

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.220
is the one that tends
to make us more alert,

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.140
and the parasympathetic nervous system

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.920
is the portion of the
autonomic nervous system

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.040
makes us feel more calm.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.500
- Right.
- In broadcasting.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.820
Right, to first approximation, right?

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.920
So, this is both of these systems

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.090
are within the grasp
of the circadian system

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.060
through hypothalamic circuits.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.590
One of the circuits that will be I think,

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.070
of particular interest
to some of your listeners

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:43.836
is a pathway that involves
this sympathetic branch

00:30:43.836 --> 00:30:45.420
of the autonomic nervous system

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.770
the fight or flight system

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.950
that is actually through
a very circuitous route

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.830
innervating the pineal gland

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.026
which is sitting in the
middle of your brain.

00:30:55.026 --> 00:30:57.010
- The so-called third eye.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:58.390
- Right, so this is.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.640
- We'll have to get back to
why it's called the third eye,

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.550
because, yeah.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.383
- That's an interesting thing.

00:31:02.383 --> 00:31:05.280
- You can't call something
the third eye and just.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.820
- Just leave it there.
- Just leave it there.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.490
- Right.
- Right.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.790
- Anyway, this is the
major source of melatonin

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:11.623
in your body.

00:31:11.623 --> 00:31:14.140
- So light comes in to my eye.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.250
- Yes.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.610
- Passed off to the
suprachiasmatic nucleus

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.920
essentially, not the light itself,

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.270
but the signal representing the light.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.103
- Sure.

00:31:22.103 --> 00:31:24.340
- Then the SCN, the
suprachiasmatic nucleus

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.210
can impact the melatonin system.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.490
- Right.
- Via the pineal?

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.650
- Right, the way this is seen is that,

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:33.920
if you were to measure
your melatonin level

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.320
over the course of the day,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.180
if you could do this hour by hour,

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.520
you'd see that it's
really low during the day,

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.210
very high at night.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.150
But if you get up in
the middle of the night

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:44.983
and go to the bathroom

00:31:44.983 --> 00:31:47.130
and turn on the bright
full fluorescent light,

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.500
your melatonin level is
slammed to the floor.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.350
Light is directly impacting
your hormonal levels

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.180
through this mechanism
that we just described.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.342
So this is one of the routes

00:31:58.342 --> 00:32:03.342
by which light can act
on your hormonal status

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.430
through pathways that
are completely beyond

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.460
what you normally would
think about, right?

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.550
You're thinking about the
things in the bathroom.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:13.830
Oh, there's the toothbrush,
there's the tube of toothpaste.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.680
But meanwhile, this other
system is just counting photons

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.100
and saying oh wow, there's
a lot of photons right now

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.460
let's shut down the melatonin release.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.280
- This is one of the main reasons
why I've encouraged people

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.320
to avoid bright light exposure
in the middle of the night.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.120
Not just blue light, but
bright light of any wavelength,

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.810
because there's this myth
out there that blue light

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.710
because it's the optimal signal
for activating this pathway

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.520
and shutting down melatonin,

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.420
is the only wavelength of
light that can shut it down.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.380
But am I correct in thinking that

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.820
if a light is bright enough.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.653
- Right.

00:32:47.653 --> 00:32:49.310
- It doesn't matter if it's
blue light, green light,

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.970
purple light, even red light.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:51.803
- Right.

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:54.730
- You're going to slam
melatonin down to the ground

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.980
which is not a good thing to happen

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.813
in the middle of the night.

00:32:57.813 --> 00:32:58.646
- Right.
- Correct?

00:32:58.646 --> 00:33:02.290
Right, yeah, any light
will affect the system

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:06.440
to some extent, the blue light
is somewhat more effective,

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.010
but don't fool yourself into thinking

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:09.930
that if you use red light

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.178
that means you're avoiding the effect,

00:33:12.178 --> 00:33:14.460
it's certainly still there.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.660
And certainly, if it's very bright,

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.450
it'll be more effective
in driving the system

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.060
than dim blue light would be.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.227
- Interesting, a lot of
people wear blue blockers.

00:33:22.227 --> 00:33:23.610
- Right.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:28.470
- And in a kind of odd twist
of misinformation out there,

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:29.710
a lot of people wear blue blockers

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.120
during the middle of the day,

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.920
which basically makes no sense

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.060
because during the middle of the day

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.900
is when you want to get
a lot of bright light

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.420
and including blue light
into your eyes, correct?

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.920
- Absolutely, and not just for the reasons

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.530
we've been talking about in
terms of circadian effects,

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.133
there are major effects of light on mood.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.870
And seasonal affective
disorder apparently,

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:55.840
is essentially a reflection of
this same system in reverse.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.690
If you're living in the northern climes

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.610
and you're not getting that much light

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.243
during the middle of
the winter in Stockholm,

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.570
you might be prone to depression

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:09.420
and phototherapy might be
just the ticket for you

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.054
and that's because there's a
direct effect of light on mood,

00:34:13.054 --> 00:34:16.127
there's an example where if
you don't have enough light

00:34:16.127 --> 00:34:17.650
it's a problem.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:18.710
So I think you're exactly right.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.410
It's not about is like
good or bad for you,

00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:22.710
it's about what kind of light and when

00:34:23.855 --> 00:34:25.129
that makes the difference.

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:27.270
Yeah, the general rule of
thumb that I've been living by,

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.110
is to get as much bright light in my eyes

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.670
ideally from sunlight
anytime I want to be alert.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.503
- Right.

00:34:33.503 --> 00:34:35.990
- And doing exactly the opposite
when I want to be asleep.

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:37.320
- Yeah.
- We're getting drowsy.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.880
- And there are aspects
of this that spin out

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.660
way beyond the conversation
we're having now

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.370
to things like this.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.580
It turns out that the incidence of myopia.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.840
- Nearsightedness.
- Nearsightedness, right.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.590
Is strongly related to the amount of time

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.076
that kids spend outdoors.

00:34:56.076 --> 00:34:57.770
- In what direction of effect?

00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:59.830
- The more they spend time outdoors,

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.160
the less nearsightedness they have.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.900
- So this is not because
they're viewing things

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.733
at a distance,

00:35:04.733 --> 00:35:07.100
or because they're getting a
lot of blue light, sunlight?

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.180
- It's a great question,
it is not fully resolved

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.620
what the epidemiological,

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.400
what the basis of that
epidemiological finding is,

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.190
one possibility is the amount of light

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.130
which would make me think

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.970
about this melanopsin system again.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:22.355
But it might very well be
a question of accommodation

00:35:22.355 --> 00:35:25.970
that is the process by which
you focus on near or far things

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.360
if you're never outdoors,
everything is nearby.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.358
If you're outdoors, you're
focusing far, so this is.

00:35:30.358 --> 00:35:31.570
- Or unless you are on your phone?

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.900
- Right, exactly.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.040
- There's a tremendous
amount of interest these days

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.580
in watches and things that count steps.

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.840
I'm beginning to realize

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.680
that we should probably have a
device that can count photons

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.513
during the day.

00:35:45.513 --> 00:35:46.346
- Right.

00:35:46.346 --> 00:35:47.630
- And can also count photons at night

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.430
and tell us hey, you're
getting too many photons,

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:51.050
you're going to shut down
your melatonin at night,

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:52.360
or you're not getting enough photons,

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.900
today you didn't get enough bright light,

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.376
whether or not it's from
artificial light or from sunlight.

00:35:56.376 --> 00:35:58.409
I guess that, where would you put?

00:35:58.409 --> 00:35:59.242
I guess you put on the top of your head

00:35:59.242 --> 00:36:02.640
or you'd probably want it
someplace outward facing?

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.590
- Right, probably what you
need is as many photons

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.280
over as much of the retina as possible

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.360
to recruit as much of
the system as possible.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.650
- In thinking about other effects

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.200
of this non-image forming pathway

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.800
that involves these special
cells in the eye and the SCN,

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.580
you had a paper a few years ago

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:26.580
looking at retinal input
to an area of the brain

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.790
which has a fancy name the peri-habenular,

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.030
but names don't necessarily matter

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.410
that had some important effects on mood

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.490
and other aspects of light.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:40.450
Maybe you could tell us a little bit

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.820
about what is the peri-habenular?

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.130
- Oh, wow, so that's a fancy term,

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.080
but I think the way to think about this,

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.690
is a chunk of the brain

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.720
that is sitting as part of a bigger chunk

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.160
that's really the linker
between peripheral sensory input

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.803
of all kinds, virtually all kinds,

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:04.600
whether it's auditory
input or tactile input

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:09.240
or visual input to the region
of your brain the cortex

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.793
that allows you to
think about these things

00:37:10.793 --> 00:37:13.807
and make plans around
them and to integrate them

00:37:13.807 --> 00:37:15.053
and that kind of thing.

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:21.834
So, we've known about a pathway

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:27.420
that gets from the retina through
this sort of linker center

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.245
which it's called the thalamus, and then.

00:37:30.245 --> 00:37:31.605
[indistinct]

00:37:31.605 --> 00:37:34.250
Exactly, but you want to
arrive at the destination.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.460
Right now you're at grand central

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.740
and now you can do your thing

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.340
'cause you're up at the cortex.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.130
So this is the standard pattern.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:41.870
You have sensory input
coming from the periphery,

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.400
you've got these peripheral elements

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.970
that are doing the initial stages of.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:46.803
- The eye, the ear, the nose.

00:37:46.803 --> 00:37:49.878
- Your skin of your fingertips, right?

00:37:49.878 --> 00:37:51.510
The taste buds on your tongue

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.480
they're taking this raw information in

00:37:54.594 --> 00:37:56.500
and they're doing some pre-processing

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.900
maybe or the early circuits are.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.410
But eventually, most of these signals

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:02.680
have to pass through the
gateway to the cortex

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.680
which is the thalamus.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.842
And we've known for years,
for decades, many decades,

00:38:08.842 --> 00:38:11.770
what the major throughput
pathway from the retina

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.510
to the cortex is and where it ends up.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.040
It ends up in the visual cortex.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.300
You pat the back of your head

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.820
that's where the receiving center is

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.840
for the main pathway
from retina to cortex.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.690
But wait a minute, there's more.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.392
There's this little side pathway

00:38:27.392 --> 00:38:28.550
that goes through a different part

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.662
of that linking thalamus center.

00:38:31.662 --> 00:38:32.780
[indistinct]

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.820
- Like a local train.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.103
- Yeah.
- From grand central to.

00:38:35.103 --> 00:38:37.600
- It's in a weird part of
the neighborhood, right?

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.520
It's a completely different,
it's like a little trunk line

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.630
that branches off and goes
out into the hinterlands

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.460
and it's going to the
part of this linker center

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.820
that's talking to a completely
different part of cortex

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.310
way up front, frontal lobe,

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:54.110
which is much more involved
in things like planning,

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:57.369
or self-image or.

00:38:57.369 --> 00:38:59.010
- Self-image literally, how one.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.920
- Views oneself, do you
feel good about yourself,

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.443
or what's your plan for next Thursday.

00:39:08.129 --> 00:39:11.040
It's a very high level center

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.600
in the highest level
of your nervous system

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.070
and this is the region
that is getting input

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:19.843
from this pathway which is
mostly worked out in its function

00:39:19.843 --> 00:39:21.340
by [indistinct] Tara's Lab.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.180
I know you had him on the podcast.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.230
- We didn't talk about this path.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:25.670
- This pathway at all right.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:29.520
So Dale Fernandez and [indistinct]

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.110
and the folks that work with them,

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:35.020
were able to show that this
pathway doesn't just exist

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.830
and get you to a weird place.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:41.830
But if you activate it at
kind of the wrong time of day,

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.360
animals can become depressed.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.750
And if you silence it under
the right circumstances,

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:53.700
then weird lighting cycles that
would normally make them act

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.560
sort of depressed, no
longer have that effect.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.700
- So it sounds to me like
there's this pathway from eye

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:05.190
to this unusual train
route through the structure

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.780
we call the thalamus,

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.160
then up to the front of the brain

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.650
that relates to things of self-perception,

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:13.400
kind of higher level functions.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.490
I find that really interesting,

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:15.363
because most of what I think about

00:40:15.363 --> 00:40:17.760
when I think about these fancy,

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.320
well, or these primitive rather,

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.890
neurons that don't pay attention
to the shapes of things,

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.040
but instead to brightness I think of well,

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.530
it regulates melatonin
and circadian clock,

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:31.730
mood, hunger, the really
kind of vegetative stuff

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:32.563
if you will.
- Right.

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:36.830
- And this is interesting
because I think a lot of people

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:37.910
experience depression

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:40.680
not just people that live in Scandinavia

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.130
in the middle of winter, and
we are very much divorced

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.833
from our normal interactions with light.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:49.820
It also makes me realize

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.956
that these intrinsically
photosensitive cells

00:40:51.956 --> 00:40:53.820
that set the clock et cetera,

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.170
are involved in a lot of things.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.800
They seem to regulate a dozen

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.533
or more different basic functions.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.240
I want to ask you about a different aspect

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.920
of the visual system now,

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.920
which is the one that relates
to our sense of balance.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.640
So I love boats but I hate being on them.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.420
I love the ocean from shore,

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.570
because I get incredibly
seasick, it's awful.

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:21.632
I think I'm going to get seasick
if I think about it too much.

00:41:21.632 --> 00:41:22.465
[laughs]

00:41:22.465 --> 00:41:23.330
And once I went on a boat trip,

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:28.330
I came back and I actually got
motion sick or wasn't seasick

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.290
'cause I was rafting.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.690
So there's a system that
somehow gets messed up.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.760
They always tell us if you're feeling sick

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.160
to look at the horizon
et cetera, et cetera.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.230
- Right.
- So what is the link

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:40.740
between our visual system
and our balance system

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.370
and why does it make us nauseous sometimes

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.700
when the world is moving in a way

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.130
that we're not accustomed to?

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:47.963
- Right.

00:41:47.963 --> 00:41:48.900
- I realize this is a big question,

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.490
because it involves eye
movement, et cetera.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.600
- Right.
- But let's maybe just walk in

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:58.600
at the simplest layers
of vision, vestibular,

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.350
so-called balance system

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.320
and then maybe we can piece
the system together for people

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.180
so that they can understand,

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.880
and then also we should
give them some tools

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.640
for adjusting their nausea

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.000
when their vestibular
system is out of whack.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.543
- Cool, so the first thing to think about

00:42:13.543 --> 00:42:18.543
is that the vestibular system
is designed to allow you

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.720
to see how your or detect sense

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.993
how you're moving in the
world, through the world.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:34.360
It's a funny one because
it's about your movement

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.300
in relationship to the world in a sense,

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.840
and yet it's sort of interoceptive

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.080
in the sense that it is really

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.170
in the end sensing the
movement of your own body.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:47.160
- Okay, so interoception

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.500
we should probably delineate for people

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.700
is when you're focusing
on your internal state

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.140
as opposed to something outside you.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.530
- Right.

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.320
- It's a gravity sensing system.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.540
- Well, it's partly a
gravity sensing system

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:02.540
in the sense that gravity is
a force that's acting on you

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.380
as if you were moving through the world

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.520
in the opposite direction.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.342
- All right, now you got to explain that.

00:43:08.342 --> 00:43:10.430
You got to explain that to me.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:13.003
- Okay, so basically the idea is that,

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:19.570
if we leave gravity inside,
we're just sitting in a car,

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.480
in the passenger seat and the
driver hits the accelerator

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.730
and you start moving
forward, you sense that.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.400
If your eyes were closed, you'd sense it.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.560
If your ears were plugged
in, your eyes would close,

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.730
you'd still know it.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.880
- Yeah, many people take
off on the plane like this

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.090
they're dreading the flight

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:36.920
and they know when the
plane is taking off.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.910
- Sure, that's your
vestibular system talking,

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.200
because anything that jostles you out

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.070
of the current position
you're in right now

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:46.653
will be detected by the
vestibular system pretty much.

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:49.610
So this is a complicated system,

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.860
but it's basically in your inner ear

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.044
very close to where you're hearing.

00:43:54.044 --> 00:43:56.894
- That they put it there.

00:43:56.894 --> 00:43:58.018
And I don't know.

00:43:58.018 --> 00:43:59.242
- And I don't really know,
they're sort of derived.

00:43:59.242 --> 00:44:00.075
[indistinct]

00:44:00.075 --> 00:44:01.430
- Now I'm just kidding.

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.970
To steal our friend Russ
Van Gelder's explanation,

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.421
we weren't consulted the
design phase and no one.

00:44:06.421 --> 00:44:08.517
- That's a great [indistinct].

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.740
- But it's interesting it's in the ear.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.280
- Yeah.
- Right?

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.650
- Yeah, it's deep in there

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:18.520
and it's served by the same nerve actually

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.630
that serves the hearing system.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.430
One way to think about it
is both the hearing system

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:26.870
and this vestibular
self-motion sensing system

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.287
are really detecting the signal

00:44:28.287 --> 00:44:32.255
in the same way they're hairy
cells and they're exciting.

00:44:32.255 --> 00:44:33.465
[indistinct]

00:44:33.465 --> 00:44:35.290
- Yeah, sort of they got
little cilia sticking up

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:36.830
off the surfaces.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.730
And depending on which way you bend those,

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.110
the cells will either
be inhibited or excited,

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:44.070
they're not even neurons but
then they talk to neurons

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.130
with a neuron-like process and off you go.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:47.560
Now you've got an auditory signal

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.500
if you're sensing things
bouncing around in your cochlea

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.110
which is.
- Sound waves.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:55.780
- Sympathetically the
bouncing of your eardrum

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.597
which is symmetrically the
sound waves in the world.

00:44:58.597 --> 00:45:01.280
But in the case of the
vestibular apparatus,

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.710
evolution has built a system

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:07.710
that detects the motion of say
fluid going by those hairs.

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:11.300
And if you put a sensor
like that in a tube

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.060
that's fluid filled,

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.604
now you've got a sensor
that will be activated

00:45:14.604 --> 00:45:18.810
when you rotate that tube around the axis

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.020
that passes through the middle of it,

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.391
those we're just listening won't be able.

00:45:22.391 --> 00:45:23.550
[indistinct]

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.450
- I was thinking of it
as three hula hoops.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:26.283
- Right, three hoops.

00:45:26.283 --> 00:45:28.280
- One standing up, one
lying down on the ground.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.113
- Right.

00:45:29.113 --> 00:45:30.353
- The other one the other way.

00:45:30.353 --> 00:45:33.470
- Three directions, the people who fly

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.820
will talk about roll pitch and
you all that kind of thing.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.852
So three axes of encoding
just like in the.

00:45:39.852 --> 00:45:40.685
[indistinct]

00:45:40.685 --> 00:45:42.230
- Sort of the yes, the no

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:44.420
and then I always say
it's the puppy head tilt.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.285
- Yeah, that puppy tilt.

00:45:45.285 --> 00:45:46.730
- That's the other one.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:47.924
So the point is that,

00:45:47.924 --> 00:45:52.290
your brain is eventually
going to be able to unpack

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:54.660
what these sensors are telling you

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.140
about how you just rotated your head

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.500
in very much the way that
the three types of cones

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.530
we were talking about before

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:04.920
are reading the incoming photons

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.025
in the wavelength domain
differently, and if.

00:46:07.025 --> 00:46:08.065
- Red, green, blue.

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:09.980
- Yeah, you can compare and
trust you get red, green, blue.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.130
So same basic idea if
you have three sensors

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:14.640
and you array them properly,

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.220
now you can tell if you're
rotating your head left or right,

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.680
up or down that's the sensory signal

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.410
coming back into your brain

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.600
confirming that you've just
made a movement that you will.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.730
- But what about on the plane?

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:28.700
Because when I'm on the plane,

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.810
I'm completely stationary
the plane's moving.

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:31.643
- Right.

00:46:31.643 --> 00:46:32.476
- But my head hasn't moved.
- Right.

00:46:32.476 --> 00:46:35.610
- So I'm just moving
forward, gravity is constant.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:36.443
- Exactly.

00:46:36.443 --> 00:46:37.920
- How do I know I'm accelerating?

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.990
- So what's happening now

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:41.193
is your brain is sensing the motion,

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:45.970
and the brain is smart
enough also to ask itself,

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:50.580
did I will that movement or
did that come from the outside?

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.560
So now in terms of sort of understanding

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.720
what the the vestibular signal means,

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.340
it's got to be embedded in the context

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.920
of what you tried to do,

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.760
or what your other sensory
systems are telling you

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.770
about what's happening.

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:04.939
- I see, so it's very interesting.

00:47:04.939 --> 00:47:07.700
But it's not conscious or
at least if it's conscious,

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.580
it's very not conscious, it's
definitely very fast, right?

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:12.860
The moment that plane starts moving,

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.320
I know that I didn't get up out
of my chair and run forward.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.153
- Right.

00:47:16.153 --> 00:47:16.986
- But I'm not really thinking about

00:47:16.986 --> 00:47:18.862
getting up out of my chair I just know.

00:47:18.862 --> 00:47:21.560
- I guess the way i
think about it is that,

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:26.370
the nervous system is
quote, aware at many levels

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.010
when it gets all the way up to the cortex

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:30.460
and we're thinking about it,

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.190
you're talking about it, that's cortical.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:37.420
But the lower levels of the brain

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.450
that don't require you to
actually actively think about it

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:44.049
they're just doing their thing
are also made aware, right?

00:47:44.049 --> 00:47:45.930
A lot of this is happening
under the surface

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:48.800
of what you're thinking,
these are reflexes.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.470
- Okay, so we've got this
gravity sensing system?

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:53.303
- Right.

00:47:55.879 --> 00:47:57.140
- I'm nodding for those that are listening

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.220
for a yes movement of the head,

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.570
a no movement of the head
or the tilting of the head

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:02.760
from side to side.
- Right.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.200
- And then you said that
knowledge about whether or not

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.010
activation of that system
comes from my own movements,

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:12.160
or something acting upon
me like the plane moving.

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.993
- Right.

00:48:12.993 --> 00:48:15.680
- Has to be combined with other signals.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.620
And so, how is the visual information

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.090
or information about the visual world

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:22.910
combined with balance information?

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:25.183
- Right, so yeah.

00:48:25.183 --> 00:48:27.350
I guess maybe the best way to think about

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:30.000
how these two systems work together,

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.450
is to think about what
happens when you suddenly

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:34.033
rotate your head to the left.

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:36.650
When you suddenly rotate
your head to the left,

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.820
your eyes are actually
rotating to the right.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:43.280
Automatically, you do
this in complete darkness.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.120
If you had an infrared
camera and watched yourself

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.820
in complete darkness,
you can't see anything.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.820
Rotating your head to the left,

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.500
your eyes would rotate to the right.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.473
That's your vestibular system saying,

00:48:56.021 --> 00:49:01.010
I'm going to try to compensate
for the head rotation.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:04.180
So my eyes are still
looking in the same place.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.450
Why is that useful, well,
if it's always doing that,

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.280
then the image of the world on your retina

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.850
will be pretty stable most of the time

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:14.840
and that actually helps vision.

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.340
- Have they built this into
cameras for image stabilization

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.420
'cause when I move, when I
take a picture with my phone,

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.490
it's blurry, it's not clear?

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:25.650
- Well actually, you might
want to get a better phone,

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:29.660
because now what they have is
software in the better apps

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.650
that will do a kind of
image stabilization post-hoc

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:34.047
by doing a registration of the images

00:49:34.047 --> 00:49:35.780
that are bouncing around,

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.240
they say the edge of the house was here,

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.590
so let's get that aligned
in each of your images.

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:44.770
So you may not be aware if
you're using a good new phone

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:49.770
that if you walk around a
landscape and hold your phone,

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.990
that there's all this image
stabilization going on.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:57.936
But it's built into standard
cinematic technology now,

00:49:57.936 --> 00:50:00.210
because if we tried to
do a handheld camera,

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:01.580
things would be bouncing around,

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:02.790
things would be unwatchable,

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:04.140
you wouldn't be able to really understand

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.560
what's going on in the scene.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.720
So the brain works really hard

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.887
to mostly stabilize the image
of the world on your retina

00:50:11.887 --> 00:50:13.500
and of course you're
moving through the world

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.870
so you can't stabilize everything.

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:17.740
But the more you can
stabilize most of the time,

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.060
the better you can see.

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.910
And that's why when we're scanning a scene

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.620
looking around at things,

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.840
we're making very rapid eye movements

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.440
for very short periods of
time and then we just rest,

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.930
but we're not the only ones that do that.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:33.120
If you ever watch a hummingbird,

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.358
it does exactly the same
thing at a feeder, right?

00:50:35.358 --> 00:50:36.191
[indistinct]

00:50:36.191 --> 00:50:37.040
It is with its body.

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.690
It's going to make a quick movement,

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:41.450
and then it's going to be stable.

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:44.530
And when you watch a pigeon
walking on the sidewalk,

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:46.157
it does this funny head bobbing thing.

00:50:46.157 --> 00:50:47.220
But what it's really doing,

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.681
is racking its head back on its neck

00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:51.280
while its body goes forward

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.390
so that the image of the
visual world stays static.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:55.658
- Is that why they're doing it?

00:50:55.658 --> 00:50:58.780
- Yes, and you've seen
the funny chicken videos

00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.613
on YouTube, right?

00:50:59.613 --> 00:51:01.140
- You take a chicken move it up and down

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.710
the head stays in one place,
it's all the same thing.

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:06.210
All of these animals are trying hard

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.820
to keep the image of the
world stable on their retina

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.880
as much of the time as they possibly can.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.320
And then when they've got
to move, make it fast,

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.380
make it quick and then stabilize again.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.920
- That's why the pigeons
have their head back?

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.060
- It is, yeah.

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.540
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:21.718
- I just need to pause there for a second

00:51:21.718 --> 00:51:23.943
and digest that, amazing.

00:51:25.271 --> 00:51:26.653
In case people aren't.

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.120
Well, there's no reason
why people would know

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.360
what we're doing here, but essentially,

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.740
what we're doing is we're
building up from sensory

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:38.480
light onto the eye, make
color to what the brain does

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.340
with the integration of
that circadian clock,

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:42.173
melatonin, et cetera.

00:51:42.173 --> 00:51:43.006
And now what we're doing

00:51:43.006 --> 00:51:45.830
is we're talking about
multi-sensory or multimodal

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:49.897
combining one sense vision
with another sense balance.

00:51:49.897 --> 00:51:50.730
- Right.

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.800
- And it turns out that pigeons

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.070
know more about this than I do,

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.290
because pigeons know
to keep their head back

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:57.990
as they walk forward.
- Right.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.700
- All right, so that gets us to this issue

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.560
of motion sickness.
- Right.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.710
- And you don't have to go out on a boat.

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.120
Anytime I go to New York, I sit in an Uber

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.450
or in a cab in the back.

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:13.260
And if I'm looking at my phone
while the car is driving,

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.290
I feel nauseous by time I
arrive at my destination.

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:17.123
- Right.

00:52:17.123 --> 00:52:19.500
- I always try and look out
the front of the windshield,

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.300
because I'm told that helps
but it's a little tiny window.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.133
- Right.

00:52:23.133 --> 00:52:27.000
- And I end up feeling slightly
less sick if I do that.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000
So what's going on with the
vision and the balance system

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:34.330
that causes a kind of a nausea?

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:35.680
And actually, if I keep
talking about this.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.513
[indistinct]

00:52:36.513 --> 00:52:37.346
[laughs]

00:52:37.346 --> 00:52:41.540
I don't throw up easily, but
for some reason motion sickness

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.610
is a real thing for me.

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:44.623
- It's a problem for a lot of people.

00:52:44.623 --> 00:52:47.130
I think the fundamental problem typically,

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.320
when you get motion sick

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:52.750
is what they call visual
vestibular conflict.

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:55.350
That is, you have two sensory systems

00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:56.490
that are talking to your brain

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:58.500
about how you're moving through the world.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:02.430
And as long as they agree you're fine.

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:04.120
So if you're driving,

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.160
your body senses that
you're moving forward.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.920
Your vestibular system is picking up

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.168
this acceleration of the car,

00:53:12.168 --> 00:53:14.606
and your visual system is
seeing the consequences

00:53:14.606 --> 00:53:19.400
of forward motion in the
sweeping of the scene past you.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.819
Everything is honky-dory,
right, no problem.

00:53:21.819 --> 00:53:25.620
But when you are headed forward

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.900
but you're looking at your cell phone,

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:28.106
what is your retina seeing?

00:53:28.106 --> 00:53:30.330
Your retina is seeing the
stable image of the screen.

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:33.570
There's absolutely no motion in that.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.315
- Or the motion is just or some
other emotion like a movie.

00:53:36.315 --> 00:53:39.250
- If you're playing a game
or you're watching a video,

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:41.700
a football game, the motion is uncoupled

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.340
with what's actually
happening to your body.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.610
Your brain doesn't like that,

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:48.320
your brain likes everything to be aligned.

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.301
And if it's not, it's
going to complain to you.

00:53:50.301 --> 00:53:51.703
- By making me feel nauseous.

00:53:51.703 --> 00:53:52.536
- By making you feel nauseous

00:53:52.536 --> 00:53:53.910
and maybe you'll change your behavior.

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:55.850
So you're getting.
- I'm getting punished.

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:57.991
- Yeah, for setting it up.

00:53:57.991 --> 00:53:59.350
[indistinct]

00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:01.160
- Right.
- By the vestibular?

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.252
- You'll learn.
- Visuals.

00:54:02.252 --> 00:54:04.180
[laughs]

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:06.470
In time, I love it.

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:08.600
I love the idea of reward signals

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.740
and we've done a lot of
discussion about this

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.170
on this podcast of things like
dopamine reward and things,

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:17.163
but also punishment signals
and I love this example.

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:20.053
Well, maybe marching a little bit further

00:54:20.053 --> 00:54:21.633
along this pathway,

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:25.943
visual input is combined
with balance input.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.370
Where does that occur,

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:32.190
and maybe 'cause I have some
hint of where it occurs.

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:33.240
You could tell us a little bit

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.580
about this kind of
mysterious little mini-brain

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:40.140
that they call the cerebellum.
- Cerebellum, yeah.

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:44.790
So the way I tried to describe
the cerebellum to my students

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.140
is that, it serves sort of like

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:53.383
the air traffic control system
functions in air travel.

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:57.241
So that it's a system
that's very complicated

00:54:57.241 --> 00:55:01.100
and it's really dependent
on great information.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.320
So it's taking in information

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.670
about everything that's
happening everywhere

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:07.690
not only through your sensory systems,

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:10.150
but it's listening into
all the little centers

00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:11.140
elsewhere in your brain

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:12.800
that are computing what
you're going to be doing next

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:13.633
and so forth.

00:55:13.633 --> 00:55:15.760
So it's just ravenous for
that kind of information.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.730
- So it really is like
a little mini-brain.

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:21.843
- It is, it's got access
to all those signals.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:27.560
and it really has an
important role in coordinating

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:32.560
and shaping movements, but
if you suddenly eliminated

00:55:33.347 --> 00:55:36.500
the air traffic control system,

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.980
planes could still take off and land

00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:43.980
but you might have some unhappy
accidents in the process.

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:45.890
So the cerebellum is kind of like that.

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:48.200
It's not that you would be paralyzed

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.940
if your cerebellum was gone

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.380
because you still have motor neurons,

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.160
you still have ways to
talk to your muscles,

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.470
you still have reflex centers,

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:59.840
and it's not like you
would have any sensory laws

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.500
because you still have your cortex

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.050
getting all of those beautiful signals

00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:05.010
that you can think about,

00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:09.420
but you wouldn't be coordinating
things so well anymore.

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:12.910
The timing between input
and output might be off.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:16.700
Or if you were trying to
practice a new athletic move

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.290
like an overhead serve in tennis,

00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:21.403
you'd be just terrible at learning.

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:25.270
All the sequences of muscle movements

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:27.370
and the feedback from
your sensory apparatus

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:29.850
that would let you really
hit that ball exactly

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:32.522
where you wanted to
after the nth rep, right?

00:56:32.522 --> 00:56:36.110
Now 1000th rep or something
you get much better at it.

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:37.460
So the cerebellum is all involved

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:42.460
in things like motor learning
and refining the precisions

00:56:43.079 --> 00:56:47.210
of movement so that they
get you where you want to go

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:49.950
if you reach for a glass of champagne

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:52.203
that you don't knock
it over or stop short.

00:56:53.542 --> 00:56:54.580
[indistinct]

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:57.310
- People who have selective
damage to the cerebellum.

00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:00.703
- Absolutely.
- And I'm familiar with.

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.450
Well, Korsakoff's is different, right?

00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:07.570
Isn't that a B vitamin
deficiency in chronic alcoholics?

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.230
- Right.
- And they tend to walk

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:12.122
kind of bow-legged and they
can't coordinate their movements.

00:57:12.122 --> 00:57:16.460
That has some that not memory
bodies but also a cerebellum?

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:19.060
- I'm not sure about the
cerebellar involvement there.

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:23.880
But the typical thing would be a patient

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.633
who has a cerebral or stroke
or a tumor for example,

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:33.090
might be not that steady on their feet

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:37.621
if the dynamics of the
situation you're standing

00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:40.840
on a street car with no
handle pull to hold on to,

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.990
they might not be as good at adjusting

00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:45.363
all the little movements of the car.

00:57:47.059 --> 00:57:49.340
There's a kind of tremor that can occur

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.003
as they're reaching for things,

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.570
because they reach a little too far

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:57.510
and then they over correct and
come back, things like that.

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:02.510
So it's very common neurological
phenomenon actually.

00:58:03.609 --> 00:58:07.250
Cerebellar ataxia is what
the neurologists call it,

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.160
and it can happen not just
with cerebellar damage,

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.440
but damage to the tracts
that feed the information

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.273
into the cerebellum.

00:58:12.273 --> 00:58:13.106
- Right, it is the private structure.

00:58:13.106 --> 00:58:15.030
- Exactly, or output from the cerebellum.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:17.870
- And so, the cerebellum
is where a lot of visual

00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:19.900
and balance information is combined.

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.960
- In a very key place in the cerebellum,

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:26.310
which it's really one of the oldest parts.

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:29.592
- In terms of flocculus.
- The flocculus, right.

00:58:29.592 --> 00:58:33.170
It's a critical place in
the cerebellum where visual

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:35.350
and vestibular information comes together

00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:38.270
recording just the kinds of
movements we were talking about.

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:41.870
This image stabilizing network
it's all happening there.

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:43.610
And there's learning
happening there as well.

00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:45.910
So that if your vestibular apparatus

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:48.840
is a little bit damaged somehow,

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:52.810
your visual system is actually
talking to your cerebellum

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.870
saying there's a problem
here, there's an error,

00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:58.820
and your cerebellum is
learning to do better

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:01.260
by increasing the output
of the vestibular system

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.680
to compensate for whatever that loss was.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.330
So it's a little error correction system

00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:08.400
that's sort of typical
of a cerebellar function

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.170
and it can happen in many,
many different domains.

00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:13.480
This is just one of the domains
of sensory motor integration

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.283
that takes place there.

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.700
- So I should stay off
my phone in the Ubers.

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:22.300
if I'm on a boat, I
should essentially look

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:25.421
and as much as possible act
as if I'm driving the machine.

00:59:25.421 --> 00:59:27.100
- Right.
- That'd be weird

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:28.170
if I was in the passenger seat

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:29.480
pretending I was driving the machine.

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:30.650
But i do always feel better

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:32.690
if I'm sitting in the
front seat passenger.

00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:35.780
- Right, so more of the
visual world that you can see

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.903
as if you were actually
the one doing the motion

00:59:37.903 --> 00:59:39.430
I would think.

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:41.030
- Let's stay in the inner ear for a minute

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:44.393
as we continue to march
around the nervous system.

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.510
When you take off in the
plane or when you land

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:50.080
or sometimes in the middle of there,

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:53.313
your ears get clogged or at
least my ears get clogged,

00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.600
that's because of pressure
buildup in the various tubes

00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.370
of the inner ear, et
cetera, we'll get into this.

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:05.130
But years ago, our good
friend Harvey Karten,

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:08.170
is a another world-class neuroanatomist

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:13.700
gave a lecture and talked
about how plugging your nose

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:16.650
and blowing out versus plugging
your nose and sucking in

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.140
should be done at different times

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:23.650
depending on whether or not
you're taking off or landing.

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:26.360
And I always see people
trying to unpop their ears.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.380
- Right.
- And when you do scuba diving

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:31.410
you learn how to do this
without necessarily I can do it

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:32.910
by just kind of moving my jaw now

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:35.520
'cause I've done a little bit of diving.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.750
But what's the story there?

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:39.860
We don't have to get
into all the differences

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.180
in atmospheric pressure, et cetera,

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.056
but if I'm taking off
and my ears are plugged,

01:00:44.056 --> 01:00:47.340
I've recently ascended, plane
take off, my ears are plugged,

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.580
do I plug my nose and blow out,

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.990
or do I plug my nose and suck in?

01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:52.090
- Right, so the basic idea is that,

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:57.090
if your ears feel bad because
you're going into an area

01:00:57.230 --> 01:01:01.050
of higher pressure, so if
they pressurize the cabin

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:02.724
more than the pressure that
you have on the surface

01:01:02.724 --> 01:01:06.040
of the planet, your
eardrums will be bending in

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.060
and they don't like that.

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.690
If you push them more
they'll hurt even more.

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:11.640
- It's a good description
that the pressure goes up

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.013
then they're going to bend in.

01:01:13.013 --> 01:01:14.700
- Bend in and then reverse would be true

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.680
if you go into an area of low pressure.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.060
So if you knew you started
to drive up the mountain side

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.170
the pressure's getting
lower and lower outside,

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:25.514
now the air behind your
eardrum is ballooning out.

01:01:25.514 --> 01:01:26.910
- Yep.
- Right?

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:27.743
So it's just a question

01:01:27.743 --> 01:01:30.250
of are you trying to get more
pressure or less pressure

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:32.547
behind the eardrum and there's
a little tube that does that

01:01:32.547 --> 01:01:35.600
and comes down into
back your throat there.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.296
And if you force pressure up that tube,

01:01:37.296 --> 01:01:39.550
you're going to be
putting more air pressure

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.150
into the compartment.

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:42.308
- To counter it.

01:01:42.308 --> 01:01:45.540
- If it's not enough and if you're sucking

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.500
you're going the other way.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.130
In reality, I think as long
as you open the passageway,

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:50.444
I think the pressure differential

01:01:50.444 --> 01:01:52.270
is going to solve your problem.

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:54.270
So I think you could actually blow in

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:55.990
when you're not supposed to.

01:01:55.990 --> 01:02:00.230
- Okay, so you could just hold
your nose and blow air out,

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:03.370
or hold your nose and suck in the.

01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:05.050
- Right.
- Effect either way is fine?

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:05.980
- I think so.

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.154
- Excellent, I just won
$100 from Harvey Karten.

01:02:08.154 --> 01:02:09.150
[laughs]

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:10.540
- Thank you very much, this is a lot.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.470
Harvey and I used to teach
neuroanatomy together

01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:14.220
and I was like I don't think it matters,

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.707
but thank you very much,
I'll split that with you.

01:02:16.707 --> 01:02:17.540
- Okay.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:18.532
[laughs]

01:02:18.532 --> 01:02:21.116
- This is important stuff.

01:02:21.116 --> 01:02:23.092
But it's true you hear this.

01:02:23.092 --> 01:02:24.770
So it doesn't matter either way.

01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:26.930
- I'm no expert in this area.

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:27.920
- Don't worry.
- Don't quote me.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.231
- He's not going to, well,
I'm going to quote you.

01:02:30.231 --> 01:02:32.220
But, okay, so we've talked
about the inner ear,

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.000
we've talked about the cerebellum.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.770
I want to talk about an area of the brain

01:02:35.770 --> 01:02:39.380
that is rarely discussed
which is the midbrain.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.213
- Yeah.

01:02:40.213 --> 01:02:42.860
- And for those that don't know,

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.322
the midbrain is an area
beneath the cortex.

01:02:45.322 --> 01:02:46.650
I guess we never really defined cortex

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:50.690
was kind of the outer layers
or are the outer layers

01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:54.207
of the at least mammalian
brain or human brain.

01:02:54.207 --> 01:02:56.796
But the midbrain is super interesting,

01:02:56.796 --> 01:03:01.796
because it controls a
lot of unconscious stuff,

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.913
reflexes, et cetera.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.930
And then there's this phenomenon
even called blind sight.

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:11.020
So could you please tell
us about the midbrain

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:15.700
about what it does, and
what in the world is sight?

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:19.550
- Yeah, so there's a lot of pieces there.

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:20.960
I think the first thing to say is,

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.999
if you imagine the nervous
system in your mind's eye,

01:03:24.999 --> 01:03:26.759
you see this big honking brain

01:03:26.759 --> 01:03:30.870
and then there's this little wand

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:34.570
that dangles down into your
vertical column the spinal cord

01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:36.670
and that's kind of your visual impression.

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:40.140
What you have to imagine is
starting in the spinal cord

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.567
and working your way up into
this big magnificent brain

01:03:42.567 --> 01:03:46.440
and what you would do
as you enter the skull,

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.970
is get into a little place
where the spinal cord

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:50.180
kind of thickens out.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.550
It still has that sort of long,
skinny trunk-like feeling.

01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:56.720
- It's more like a
paddle or a spoon shape.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.257
- Right, it starts to
spread out a little bit

01:03:58.257 --> 01:04:00.230
and that's 'cause your evolutionists

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:02.080
packed more interesting goodies in there

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.330
for processing information
and generating movement.

01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:10.330
So beyond that is this tween
brain we were talking about.

01:04:10.557 --> 01:04:13.443
This linker brain with
diencephalon really means

01:04:13.443 --> 01:04:14.850
the between brain.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.080
- Oh, I thought you said tween.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.780
- Well, it is, yes.
- No, no, no, between.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:18.613
Between.
- Between.

01:04:18.613 --> 01:04:19.780
[indistinct]
- You said tween.

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:22.250
- Yeah, it's the between,
it's the between brain

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:24.320
is what the name means.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.780
It's the linker from the
spinal cord in the periphery

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.107
up to these grand centers of the cortex.

01:04:30.107 --> 01:04:34.267
But this midbrain you're
talking about is the last bit

01:04:34.267 --> 01:04:37.970
of this enlarged sort of spinal
cordy thing in your skull,

01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:40.646
which is really the brain
stem is what we call it.

01:04:40.646 --> 01:04:44.040
The last bit of that before
you get to this relay up

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.990
to the cortex is the midbrain.

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:49.268
And there's a really
important visual center there,

01:04:49.268 --> 01:04:51.503
it's called the superior colliculus.

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:54.560
There's a similar center in the brains

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.460
of other vertebrate animals a
frog for example or a lizard,

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.410
would have this is called
the optic tectum there

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:06.410
but it's a center, then in
these non-mammalian vertebrates,

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.050
is really the main visual center.

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:13.320
They don't really have what
we would call a visual cortex

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.680
although there's something
sort of like that.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.570
But this is where most of the action is

01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:19.570
in terms of interpreting visual input

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:22.473
and organizing behavior around that.

01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:26.440
You can sort of think about this region

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.550
of the brain stem as a reflex center

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:33.550
that can reorient the
animal's gaze or body

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:39.410
or maybe even attention to
particular regions of space

01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:41.590
out there around the animal

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:43.493
and that could be for
all kinds of reasons.

01:05:43.493 --> 01:05:46.303
It might be a predator just
showed up in one corner

01:05:46.303 --> 01:05:48.177
of the forest and you pick that up

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:49.683
and you're trying to avoid it.

01:05:49.683 --> 01:05:52.400
- Or just any movement.
- Any movement, right?

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:57.310
It might be that suddenly
something splats on the page

01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:58.184
when you're reading a novel

01:05:58.184 --> 01:06:01.904
and your eye reflexively looks at it.

01:06:01.904 --> 01:06:04.200
You don't have to think
about that, that's a reflex.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.300
- What if you throw me a ball
but I'm not expecting it?

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.180
- Right.
- And I just reach up

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.800
try and grab it touch it or not.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.320
Is that handled by the midbrain?

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.940
- Well, that's probably not the midbrain

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:18.300
although by itself, because
it's going to involve

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.710
all these limb movements,

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:21.513
this movement of your arm and body.

01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:23.890
- What about ducking

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:25.670
if something's suddenly
thrown in your head?

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:27.100
- Sure, right, things like that

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.990
will certainly have a brainstem component,

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:32.323
a midbrain component,
something looms and you duck.

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:36.150
It may not be the superior colliculus

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:37.010
we're talking about now,

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:39.150
it might be another part
of the visual midbrain.

01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:41.690
But these are centers that emerged early

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:43.920
in the evolution of brains like ours

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.291
to handle complicated visual events

01:06:46.291 --> 01:06:48.900
that have significance for the animal

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.630
in terms of space, where is it in space?

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:53.020
And in fact, this same center

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:56.210
actually gets input from all
kinds of other sensory systems

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:58.880
that take information
from the external world

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.590
from particular locations

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:03.540
and where you might want to
either avoid or approach things

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.338
according to their significance to you.

01:07:05.338 --> 01:07:08.700
So you get input from the touch system,

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.530
you get input from the auditory system.

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:13.490
I work for a while in rattlesnakes,

01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:17.315
they get input from a
part of their warm sensors

01:07:17.315 --> 01:07:20.058
on their face, they're in
these little pits on the face.

01:07:20.058 --> 01:07:22.104
- To work on baby rattlesnakes, right?

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:23.589
- They were adults.

01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:25.670
- Oh, I wasn't trying
to diminish the danger.

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:27.290
I thought for some reason
they were little ones.

01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:28.507
- No.
- Why in the world

01:07:28.507 --> 01:07:30.280
would you work on rattlesnakes?

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.770
- Well, because they have a version

01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:35.940
of an extra receptive sensory system

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:39.020
that is they're looking out into the world

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.100
using a completely
different set of sensors.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.310
They're using the same sensors

01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:43.990
that would feel the warmth on your face

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:45.569
if you stood in front of a bonfire.

01:07:45.569 --> 01:07:48.410
Except, evolution has given them

01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:49.970
this very nice specialized system

01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:52.210
that lets them image where
the heat's coming from.

01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:53.920
You can sort of do that anyway, right?

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.260
If you walk around the fire,

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:59.590
you can feel where the
fire is from the heat

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:00.570
hitting your face.

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:04.380
- Is that the primary way
in which they detect prey?

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.710
- It's one of one of the major ways.

01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:09.140
And in fact, they use vision as well

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.140
and they bring these two systems together

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.810
in the same place in this tectum regions

01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:14.856
brain stem, midbrain.

01:08:14.856 --> 01:08:17.560
- What's the tongue jutting
about when the snakes?

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.130
- That I don't know.

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:20.770
That may be old factory, they're maybe.

01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:21.954
- They're sniffing the
air with their tongue?

01:08:21.954 --> 01:08:23.580
- Yeah, there may be, 'cause.

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:27.080
- On our drive you told me that
flies actually taste things

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.590
with their feet.
- They do, yeah.

01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:29.423
- That's so weird.

01:08:29.423 --> 01:08:33.320
- Yeah, they have taste receptors
and lots of funny places.

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.960
I want to pause here just for one second

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.540
before we get back into the midbrain.

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:40.160
I think what's so interesting
in all seriousness

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:45.080
about taste receptors
on feet, heat sensors,

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:48.500
tongues shutting out of snakes and vision

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.760
and all this integration is that,

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:55.060
it really speaks to the fact
that all these sensory neurons

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:59.750
are trying to gather information
and stuff it into a system

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:03.280
that can make meaningful
decisions and actions.

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.140
And that it really doesn't
matter whether or not

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.550
it's coming from eyes or ears
or nose or bottoms of feet,

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:11.500
because in the end, it's
just electricity flowing in.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:14.920
And so it sounds like it's
placed on each animal,

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.360
it always feels weird
to call fly an animal.

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.453
But they are creatures, they are animals.

01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:23.780
It's placed in different
locations on different animals

01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:26.527
depending on the particular
needs of that animal.

01:09:26.527 --> 01:09:29.160
- Right, but how much more powerful

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.870
if the nervous systems
can also cross-correlate

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:34.950
across sensory systems?

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:38.140
So if you've got a weak signal
from one sensory system,

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.980
you're not quite sure
there's something there.

01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:43.020
And a weak signal from
an another sensory system

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.800
that's telling you the same locations

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.360
is a little bit interesting.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.780
There might be something there

01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:50.530
if you've got those two together
you've got corroboration.

01:09:50.530 --> 01:09:53.140
Your brain now says it's much more likely

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:56.890
that that's going to be something
worth paying attention to.

01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:59.600
- Right, so maybe I'm feeling some heat

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.180
on one side of my face

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.560
and I also smell something
baking in the oven.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.690
- Right.
- So now there's,

01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:08.850
it's neither is particularly
strong, but as you said,

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:10.060
there's some corroboration.

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:11.340
- Right.
And that corroboration

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.510
is occurring in the midbrain.

01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:15.990
- Right, and then if you
throw things into conflict,

01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:17.350
now the brain is confused

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:20.050
and that may be where your
emotion sickness comes from.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:23.030
So it is great to have, as a brain,

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:24.790
it's great to have as many
sources of information

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:28.570
as you can have, just like if you're a spy

01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:30.620
or a journalist, you don't
want as much information

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.070
as you can get about what's out there,

01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:35.670
but if things conflict,
that's problematic, right?

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:37.390
Your sources are giving
you different information

01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:38.510
about what's going on.

01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:41.518
Now you've got a problem on
your hands, what do you publish?

01:10:41.518 --> 01:10:43.560
- The midbrain is so fascinating.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.020
I don't want to eject us from the midbrain

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.870
and go back to the vestibular system,

01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.680
but I do have a question
that I forgot to ask

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.550
about the vestibular system which is,

01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:53.882
why is it that for many
people including me,

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:56.460
despite my motion sickness in cabs,

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:59.250
that there's a sense of pleasure

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:02.300
in moving through space
and getting tilted relative

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.210
to the gravitational pull of the earth?

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:05.720
For me growing up it was skateboarding,

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.853
but people like to corner
in cars, corner on bikes,

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.370
maybe for some people it's
done running or dance.

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:16.350
But what is it about moving through space

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:19.720
and getting tilted a lot
of surfers around here.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.270
Getting tilted that can tap

01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:25.360
into some of the pleasure centers.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.930
Do we have any idea why
that would feel like?

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:28.610
- I have no clue.

01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:31.500
- Is there dopaminergic
input to this system?

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:36.263
- Well, the dopaminergic
system gets a lot of places.

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:41.380
It's pretty much to some
extent everywhere in the cortex

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.550
a lot more in the frontal lobe of course,

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:46.170
but that's just for starters.

01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:48.690
There's basically dopaminergic
innervation most places

01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:50.310
in the central nervous system.

01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:52.720
So there's the potential for
dopamine urging involvement

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.270
but I really have no clue
about the tilting phenomenon.

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:58.040
- People pay money to
go on roller coasters.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.690
- Right, well, I think that
may be as much about the thrill

01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:01.540
as anything.
- Sure.

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:04.833
And the falling reflex is
very robust in all of us

01:12:04.833 --> 01:12:07.190
when the visual world's going up very fast

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:08.460
it usually means that we're falling.

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:09.980
- Right.
- But some people like that,

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.330
some people don't.
- Right.

01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:16.070
And kids tolerate a lot more
sort of vestibular craziness

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:18.470
spinning around until they've dropped.

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:21.809
- And I've friends, it always
you worries me a little bit

01:12:21.809 --> 01:12:23.610
that they throw their kids.

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.000
I'm not recommending anyone do this.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.020
When they're little like throwing the kids

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:30.034
really far back and forth,
some kids seem to love it.

01:12:30.034 --> 01:12:33.910
- Yeah, yeah, our son loved
being shaken up and down

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:37.870
very vigorously, that's the only thing

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:39.290
that would calm him down sometimes.

01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:41.035
- Interesting, yeah, so I'm guessing

01:12:41.035 --> 01:12:46.035
we can guess that maybe
there's some activation

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:48.320
of the reward systems from.
- Yeah.

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.210
- Being moving through space.

01:12:50.210 --> 01:12:52.740
- Well, if you think
about how rewarding it is

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.484
to be able to move through space

01:12:54.484 --> 01:12:57.940
and how unhappy people
are who are used to that

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.690
who suddenly aren't able to do that,

01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:01.760
there is a sense of agency, right?

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.250
If you can choose to move
through the world and to tilt,

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.810
that's not only you're
moving through the world,

01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:08.450
but you're doing it with a
certain amount of finesse,

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:09.340
maybe that's what it is.

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:13.290
You can feel like you're the
master of your own movement

01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:15.119
in a way that you wouldn't
if you're going straight.

01:13:15.119 --> 01:13:17.170
I'm just blowing smoke here, right?

01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:18.930
- Yeah, well, we can
speculate, that's fine.

01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:21.440
I couldn't help but ask the question.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:25.040
Okay, so if we move ourselves pun intended

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.260
back into the midbrain,

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.130
the midbrain is combining
all these different signals

01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:31.170
for reflexive action.

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:34.920
At what point does this
become deliberate action?

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.610
Because if I look at something
I want and I want to pursue it,

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:39.180
I'm going to go toward it

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:42.360
and many times that's
a deliberate decision.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.690
- Right, so this gets
very slippery I think,

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:49.300
because what you have to try to imagine

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.030
is all these different parts of the brain

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:53.970
working on the problem of staying alive

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.020
and surviving in the world,

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.120
they're working on the
problem simultaneously,

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.953
and there's not one right
answer how to do that.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.870
But one way to think about it is that,

01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:11.760
you have high levels
of your nervous system

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.100
that are very well designed to override

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:19.580
an otherwise automatic
movement if it's inappropriate.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:23.730
So if you imagine you've been
invited to tea with the queen

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:28.730
and she hands you very fancy
Wedgewood teacup very thin.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:30.840
- Wedgewood teacup?

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:34.100
- Yes, with very hot tea in it
and you're burning your hand,

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.960
you probably will try to find
a way to put that back down

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.130
on the saucer rather than
just dropping it on the floor

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:42.770
because you're with the queen.

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:45.520
You're trying to be appropriate to that.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.400
So you have ways of reining
in automatic behaviors

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.183
if they're going to be maladaptive.

01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:54.580
But you also want the
reflex to work quickly

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.060
if it's the only thing
that's going to save you.

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.360
The looming object coming at your head,

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.300
you don't have time to think about that.

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.890
So this is the interplay

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:05.260
in these hierarchically organized centers

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.690
of the nervous system at the lowest level.

01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:10.230
You've got the automatic
sensors and centers

01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:14.500
and reflex arcs that will keep you safe

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.560
even if you don't have
time to think about it,

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.740
and then you've got the
higher center saying,

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.640
well, maybe we could do this as well

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.510
or maybe we shouldn't
do that at all, right?

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:25.700
So you have all these different levels

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.550
operating simultaneously

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:30.630
and you need bi-directional communication

01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:34.610
between high-level, cognitive centers,

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:37.427
decision-making on the one hand,

01:15:37.427 --> 01:15:40.300
and these low-level very
helpful reflexive centers,

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.099
but they're a little bit
rigid, a little hard-wired

01:15:43.099 --> 01:15:44.550
so they need some nuance.

01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:47.400
So they're both of these
things are operating in tandem

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.860
in real time, all the time in our brains

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:51.760
and sometimes we listen
more to one than the other.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.500
You've heard people in sports
talking about messing up

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.550
at the play 'cause they over thought it.

01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:59.010
Thinking too hard about it.

01:15:59.010 --> 01:16:01.880
That's partly you've already
trained your cerebellum

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.980
how to hit a fastball
right down the middle.

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.415
- Right, and if you start looking

01:16:06.415 --> 01:16:08.800
for something new or different,

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.130
you're going to mess up
your reflexive swing.

01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:12.050
- Right, if you're trying to think

01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:15.020
about the physics of the
ball as it's coming at you,

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:16.103
you've already missed, right?

01:16:16.103 --> 01:16:19.950
Because you're not using
your, all those reps

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:23.690
have built a kind of knowledge
is what you want to rely on

01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:27.133
when you don't have enough
time to contemplate.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.340
- This is important and a great segue

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.501
for what I'd like to discuss next

01:16:32.501 --> 01:16:35.920
which is the basal ganglia.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:38.240
This really interesting
of the area of the brain

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.720
that's involved in go-type commands

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.990
and behaviors instructing us to do things

01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:47.800
and no-go preventing us from doing things.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.750
Because so much of motor
learning and skill execution

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:53.560
and not saying the wrong thing

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.324
or sitting still in class

01:16:55.324 --> 01:16:59.520
or as you use with the
tea with the queen example

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:03.930
feeling discomfort involves
suppressing behavior

01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:05.338
and sometimes it's activating behavior.

01:17:05.338 --> 01:17:06.171
- Right.

01:17:06.171 --> 01:17:07.440
- A tremendous amount of online attention

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.410
is devoted to trying to
get people motivated.

01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:13.350
This isn't the main focus of our podcast.

01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:14.892
We touch on some of the
underlying neural circuits

01:17:14.892 --> 01:17:17.450
of motivation dopamine and so forth.

01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:21.030
But so much of what people
struggle with out there

01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:26.030
are elements around
failure to pay attention.

01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.863
- Right.

01:17:26.863 --> 01:17:28.340
- Or challenges in paying attention

01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:29.937
which is essentially like
putting the blinders on

01:17:29.937 --> 01:17:32.690
and they're getting a soda
straw view of the world

01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:34.720
and maintaining that for a about of work

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.940
or something of that sort and
trying to get into action.

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:42.440
So of course, this is carried
out by many neural circuits

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.620
not just the basal ganglia.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.890
But what are the basal ganglia,

01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:49.100
and what are their primary
roles in controlling

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.950
go type behavior and no-go type behavior?

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:55.175
- Yeah, so the basal
ganglia are sitting deep

01:17:55.175 --> 01:17:57.700
in what you would call the forebrains

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:00.560
or the highest levels of the brain.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:05.500
They are sort of cousins
to the cerebral cortex

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.490
which we talked about as
sort of the highest level

01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:09.817
of your brain, the thing
you're thinking with.

01:18:09.817 --> 01:18:11.552
- The cerebral cortex
being the refined cousins

01:18:11.552 --> 01:18:12.777
and then you've got the.
- Right.

01:18:12.777 --> 01:18:15.003
- The brute, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:17.610
That's probably totally unfair, but.

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:19.620
- That's right, I like the basal ganglia.

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.470
I can relate to the
brutish parts of the brain.

01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:23.940
A little bit of hypothalamus,

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:25.640
a little bit of basal ganglia, sure.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.870
- We need it all, we need it all.

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:32.870
And this area of the brain
has gotten a lot bigger

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.320
as the cortex has gotten bigger

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:39.350
and it's deeply intertwined
with cortical function.

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:41.251
The cortex can't really
do what it needs to do

01:18:41.251 --> 01:18:43.730
without the help of the
basal ganglia and vice versa.

01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:46.543
So they're really intertwined.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.370
And in a way you can think
about this logically is saying,

01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:55.087
if you have the ability
to withhold behavior

01:18:55.087 --> 01:18:58.890
or to execute it, how do
you decide which to do?

01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:01.720
Well, the cortex is going to
have to do that thinking for you.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.330
You have to be looking
at all the contingencies

01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:07.680
of your situation to decide
is this a crazy move,

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.350
or is this a really smart
investment right now or what?

01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:13.127
- I don't want to go out
for a run in the morning,

01:19:13.127 --> 01:19:15.280
but I'm going to make
myself go out for a run,

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.840
or I'm having a great time out on a run

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.130
and I know I need to get back

01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:20.740
but I kind of want to go another mile.

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.590
- I mean, another great example is that,

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:24.300
the marshmallow test for the little kids.

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.880
They can get two
marshmallows if they hold off

01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:32.550
just 30 seconds initially,
they can have one right away.

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:34.290
But if they can wait 30
seconds, they got two.

01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:37.400
So that's the no go because
their cortex is saying,

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.050
I would really like to have
two more than having one.

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.490
But they're not going to get the two

01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:45.710
unless they can not reach for the one.

01:19:45.710 --> 01:19:49.640
So they've got to hold off the action

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:53.380
and that has to result
from a cognitive process.

01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:56.683
So the cortex is involved
in this in a major way.

01:19:57.614 --> 01:19:59.020
- Yeah, as I recall in that experiment,

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.030
the kids used a variety of tools.

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:02.730
Some would distract themselves.

01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:04.410
I particularly related to the kid

01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:07.020
that would just put himself
right next to the marshmallows

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.000
and then some of the
kids covered their eyes,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.860
some of them would count or sing.

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:13.320
Yeah, so that's all very cortical, right?

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.100
Coming up with a novel strategy,

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:16.590
simple example that we're using here.

01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:19.550
But of course, this is at
play anytime someone decides

01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:21.480
they want to go watch
a motivational speech

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.280
or something just a Steve
Jobs commencement speech

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.077
just to get motivated
to engage in their day.

01:20:26.077 --> 01:20:28.306
- Should I take this new job?

01:20:28.306 --> 01:20:30.050
It's got great benefits,

01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:32.110
but it's in a lousy part of the country.

01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:36.130
- Why do you think that some
people have a harder time

01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:38.170
running these go no-go circuits

01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:42.230
and other people seem to have
very low activation energy

01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:44.780
we would say, they could
just, they have a task,

01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.090
they just lean into the task.
- Right.

01:20:46.090 --> 01:20:49.080
- Whereas some people
getting into task completion

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.480
or things of that sort is
very challenging for them?

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.960
- Yeah, I think it's really just another,

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.340
it's a special case of a
very general phenomenon

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.350
which is brains are complicated.

01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:05.350
And the brains we have
are the result of genetics

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:08.870
and experience, and my genes
are different from your genes

01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:11.040
and my experiences are
different from your experiences.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.630
So the things that would
be easy or hard for us

01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:17.170
won't necessarily be aligned,
they might just happen to be

01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:20.387
just because they are,
but the point is that,

01:21:20.387 --> 01:21:23.980
you're dealt a certain set of cards,

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:27.660
you have certain set of
genes, you are handed a brain,

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:30.710
you don't choose your
brain it's handed to you.

01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:32.330
Then there's all this
stuff you can do with it.

01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:37.330
You can learn to have new
skills or to act differently

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:42.360
or to show more restraint
which is kind of relevant

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.840
to what we're talking about here.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.830
Or maybe show less restraint

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:48.090
if your problem is
you're so buttoned down,

01:21:48.090 --> 01:21:49.260
you never have any fun in life

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.990
and you should loosen up a little bit.

01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:52.172
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

01:21:52.172 --> 01:21:53.296
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21:53.296 --> 01:21:55.360
[laughs]

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.480
David's always encouraging me

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.907
to have a little more fun in life.

01:21:57.907 --> 01:21:59.940
[laughs]

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:04.120
So basil ganglia they're
kind of the disciplinarian

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.990
or they're sort of the instructor
conductor of sorts, right?

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:11.450
Go, no-go, you be quiet, you start now.

01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:14.950
- I wish I knew more about
the basal ganglia than I do.

01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:19.370
My sense is that, this system is key

01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:23.543
for implementing the plans that
get cooked up in the cortex,

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.690
but they also influence the plans

01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:30.590
that the cortex is dishing out

01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:34.570
because this is a major source
of information to the cortex.

01:22:34.570 --> 01:22:36.950
So it becomes almost
impossible to figure out

01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:40.670
where the computation
begins and where it ends

01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:41.820
and who's doing what

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:44.240
because these things are all interacting

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.680
in a complex network, and it's all of it.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.420
It's the whole network,
it's not one is the leader

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:50.550
and the other is the follower.

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:52.530
- Right, of course, yeah,
these are all the structures

01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:55.450
that we're discussing
are working in parallel.

01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:56.283
- Right.

01:22:56.283 --> 01:22:59.180
- And there's a lot of changing crosstalk.

01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:03.300
I have this somewhat sick habit David.

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.230
Every day I try and do 21 no-gos.

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:08.190
So if I want to reach for my phone,

01:23:08.190 --> 01:23:12.120
I try and not do it just to
see if I can prevent myself

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:15.550
from engaging in that
behavior, if it was reflexive,

01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:18.550
if it's something I want
to do a deliberate choice,

01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:20.360
then I certainly allow myself to do it.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.193
- Right.

01:23:21.193 --> 01:23:22.026
- I don't tend to have too
much trouble with motivation

01:23:22.026 --> 01:23:25.920
with go type functions,
mostly because I'm so busy

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:30.920
that I'd wish I had more time
for more goes so to speak.

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.180
But do you think these circuits

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:35.240
have genuine plasticity in them?

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.270
- Absolutely, everybody
knows how they've learned

01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:42.210
over time to wait for the
two marshmallows, right?

01:23:42.210 --> 01:23:44.900
You don't have to have instant
gratification all the time.

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.290
You're willing to do a job

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:49.510
sometimes it isn't your favorite job

01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:50.880
because it comes with the territory

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.850
and you want the salary that
comes at the end of the week

01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:54.230
or the end of the month, right?

01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:57.480
So we can defer gratification.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.940
We can choose not to say the thing

01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:01.960
that we know is going
to inflame our partner

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.823
and create a meltdown for the next week.

01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:07.970
We learn this control,

01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:10.120
but I think these are
skills like any other

01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:13.110
you can get better at
them if you practice them.

01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:15.605
So I think you're choosing
to do that to spontaneously,

01:24:15.605 --> 01:24:18.820
is kind of a mental
practice, it's a discipline,

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.780
it's a way of building a
skill that you want to have.

01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:23.219
- Yeah, I find it to be something

01:24:23.219 --> 01:24:28.219
that when I engage in
a no-go type situation,

01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:32.080
then the next time and the next time

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.370
that I find myself about
to move reflexively,

01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:36.360
there's a little gap in consciousness

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.710
that I can make a decision whether or not

01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:40.860
this is really the best use of my time.

01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:43.870
Because sometimes I wonder
whether or not all this business

01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:47.000
around attention certainly
there's the case of ADHD

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.730
and clinical diagnosed ADHD.

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:51.240
But all the issue around
focus and attention

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.490
is really that people just
have not really learned

01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:56.300
how to short circuit a reflex.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:59.180
And so much of what makes us
different than rattlesnakes,

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.160
or well, actually they
could be deliberate,

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.300
but from the other animals

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:06.022
and is our ability to suppress reflex.

01:25:06.022 --> 01:25:08.300
- Yeah, well, that's the cortex.

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.775
Or let's say the forebrain.

01:25:09.775 --> 01:25:12.620
Cortex and basal ganglia
are working together

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:15.630
sitting on top of this lizard brain

01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:17.960
that's giving you all these
great adaptive reflexes

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.470
that help you survive.

01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:22.430
You just hope you don't
get the surprising case

01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:24.690
where the thing that your
reflex is telling you

01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:26.210
is actually exactly the wrong thing

01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:27.616
and you make a mistake, right?

01:25:27.616 --> 01:25:28.449
[indistinct]

01:25:28.449 --> 01:25:29.900
Right, so that's what the cortex is for.

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:33.780
It's adding nuance and
context and experience,

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:37.370
past association and in
human beings obviously,

01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:41.360
learning from others
through communication.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.660
- Well, I was, you went right to it

01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:45.710
and it was where I was going to go.

01:25:45.710 --> 01:25:47.090
So let's talk about the cortex.

01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:49.710
We've worked our way up
the so-called neuraxis

01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:54.110
as the aficionados will
know, so we're in the cortex.

01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:55.870
This is the seat of our
higher consciousness,

01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:58.230
self-image, planning and action.

01:25:58.230 --> 01:26:00.500
But as you mentioned, the
cortex isn't just about that,

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.960
it's got other regions that
are involved in other things.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.600
So maybe we should staying with vision,

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.870
let's talk a little bit
about visual cortex.

01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:11.790
You told me an amazing
story about visual cortex

01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:13.300
and it was somewhat of a sad story

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:15.860
unfortunately about
someone who had a stroke

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:17.043
to visual cortex.

01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:20.290
Maybe if you would share that story

01:26:20.290 --> 01:26:23.240
because I think it illustrates
many important principles

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.080
about what the cortex does.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.480
- Right, so the visual cortex

01:26:29.938 --> 01:26:31.610
you could say the projection screen.

01:26:31.610 --> 01:26:35.760
The first place where
this information streaming

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:40.663
from the retina through this
thalamus connecting linker

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:46.780
gets played out for the highest
level of your brain to see.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.810
It's a representation,

01:26:48.810 --> 01:26:52.580
it's a map of things going
on in the visual world

01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.063
that's in your brain.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:27:00.160
And when we describe a scene to a friend,

01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:04.490
we're using this chunk of our
brain to be able to put words

01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:07.260
which are coming from a
different part of our cortex

01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:10.750
to the objects and movements
and colors that we see

01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:11.603
in the world.

01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:17.383
So that's a key part of
your visual experience

01:27:17.383 --> 01:27:20.460
when you can describe
the things you're seeing,

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:23.650
you're looking at your
visual cortex, and this is.

01:27:23.650 --> 01:27:24.640
- Could I just ask a quick question?

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.070
So right now because I'm
looking at your face.

01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:29.030
- Right.
- As we're talking,

01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:31.040
there are neurons in my brain

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:34.730
more or less in the
configuration of your face

01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:37.830
that are active as you move about.

01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:42.830
And what if I were to close
my eyes and just imagine,

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:44.960
I do this all the time by the way David.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.111
I close my eyes and i
imagine David Berson's face.

01:27:48.111 --> 01:27:48.944
[laughs]

01:27:48.944 --> 01:27:51.120
I don't tend to do that
as often, maybe I should.

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:54.570
But you get the point, I'm
now using visualization

01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:56.930
of what you look like by way of memory.

01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:58.150
- Right.
- If we were to image

01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:02.460
the neurons in my brain,
would the activity of neurons

01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:07.460
resemble the activity of
neurons that's present

01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:09.720
when I open my eyes and
look at your actual face?

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.890
- This is a deep question,
we don't really have a full.

01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:13.723
- It seems like.

01:28:13.723 --> 01:28:15.000
[indistinct]

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.800
- Yes, except you're talking
about looking in detail

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:22.110
at the activity of
neurons in a human brain

01:28:22.110 --> 01:28:24.042
and that's not as easy to do

01:28:24.042 --> 01:28:27.130
as it would be in some
kind of animal model.

01:28:27.130 --> 01:28:29.050
But the bottom line is that,

01:28:29.050 --> 01:28:34.050
you have a spatial representation
of the visual world

01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:36.404
late as a map of the visual world

01:28:36.404 --> 01:28:38.920
lay down on the surface of your cortex.

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.500
The thing that's surprising is that,

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.880
it's not one map, it's
actually dozens of maps.

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.400
- What do each of those maps do?

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.760
- Well, we don't really have a
full accounting there either,

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:52.250
but it looks a little bit
like the diversification

01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:55.010
of the output neurons of the retina,

01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:56.950
the ganglion cells we
were talking about before.

01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:58.790
There are different
types of ganglion cells

01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:00.950
that are encoding different
kinds of information

01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:01.960
about the visual world,

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.070
we talk about the ones that
were encoding the brightness.

01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:07.740
but other ones are
encoding motion or color

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:10.600
these kinds of things, the
same kinds of specializations

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.000
in different representations
of the visual world

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.020
in the cortex seem to be true.

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:19.910
It's a complex story, we don't
have the whole picture yet,

01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:21.780
but it does look as if
some parts of the brain

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:22.613
are much more important

01:29:22.613 --> 01:29:27.613
for things like reaching for
things in the space around you.

01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:30.070
And other parts of the
cortex are really important

01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:32.820
for making associations between
particular visual things

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:35.860
you're looking at now
and their significance.

01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:38.440
What is that object,
what can it do for me,

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.650
how can I use it?

01:29:39.650 --> 01:29:42.400
- What about the really
specialized areas of cortex

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:46.500
like neurons that respond
to particular faces,

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:51.500
or neurons that I don't
know can help me understand

01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:54.720
where I am relative to
some other specific object?

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:59.010
- Right, so these are
our properties of neurons

01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:04.010
that are extracted from detected
by recording the activity

01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:09.550
of single neurons in
some experimental system.

01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:11.510
What's going on when you actually

01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:13.780
perceive your grandmother's face,

01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:15.570
is a much more complicated question

01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:17.560
and it clearly involves
hundreds and thousands

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.329
and probably millions of neurons

01:30:19.329 --> 01:30:21.490
acting in a cooperative way.

01:30:21.490 --> 01:30:23.910
So you can pick out any one little element

01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:26.060
in this very complicated system

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:28.170
and see that it's
responding differentially

01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:29.950
to certain kinds of visual patterns

01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:31.610
and you think you're seeing a glimpse

01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:33.050
of some part of the process

01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:36.140
by which you recognize
your grandmother's face.

01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:38.940
But that's a long way from
a complete description

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.950
and it certainly isn't
going to be at the level

01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:44.160
of a magic single neuron
that has the special stuff

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.460
to recognize your grandmother,
it's going to be in some pattern

01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:50.270
of activity across many, many cells

01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:52.890
resonating in some kind of special way

01:30:52.890 --> 01:30:57.570
that will represent the
internal memory of your mother.

01:30:57.570 --> 01:30:59.373
- So it's really incredible?
- Yeah.

01:30:59.373 --> 01:31:01.620
- I mean that every time
we do this deep dive

01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:02.840
which we do from time to time,

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.260
you and I we kind of like
march into the nervous system

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:10.193
and explore how different
aspects of our life experiences

01:31:10.193 --> 01:31:13.973
is handled there and how it's organized.

01:31:15.855 --> 01:31:17.650
After so many decades of doing this,

01:31:17.650 --> 01:31:22.650
it still boggles my mind that
the collection of neurons

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:26.430
one through seven active
in a particular sequence

01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:28.680
gives the memory of a particular face

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:32.270
and run backwards seven through to one,

01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:36.270
it gives you a, it could be rattlesnake

01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:38.477
pit viper heat sensing organs.
- Right.

01:31:38.477 --> 01:31:40.127
- You were talking about earlier.

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:41.900
So it sounds,

01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:44.820
is it true that there's
a lot of multi-purposing

01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:46.790
of the circuitry, like we can't say

01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:49.320
one area of the brain does A

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.990
and another area of the brain does B.

01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:55.590
So areas can multitask
or have multiple jobs.

01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:56.510
They can moonlight.

01:31:56.510 --> 01:32:01.150
- Right, but I think in my career,

01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:05.200
the hard problem has been to square that

01:32:06.190 --> 01:32:10.940
with the fact that things are specialized

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:13.233
that there are specific genes expressed

01:32:13.233 --> 01:32:17.210
in specific neurons that make
them make synaptic connections

01:32:17.210 --> 01:32:19.290
with only certain other neurons.

01:32:19.290 --> 01:32:21.920
And that particular synaptic arrangement

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:24.910
actually results in the
processing of information

01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:28.450
that's useful to the
animal to survive, right?

01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:33.450
So it's not as if it's either
a big undifferentiated network

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:35.890
of cells and looking at any one

01:32:35.890 --> 01:32:37.100
is never going to tell you anything

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:39.290
that's too extreme on the one hand,

01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:41.070
nor is it the case that
everything is hardwired

01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:42.660
and every neuron has one function

01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:45.810
and this all happens in
one place in the brain,

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:48.000
it's way more complicated and interactive

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.600
and interconnected than that.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.850
- So we're not hardwired or soft-wired?

01:32:51.850 --> 01:32:53.533
- Both.
- We're sort of,

01:32:53.533 --> 01:32:55.970
I don't know what the analogy
should be what substance

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:57.130
would work best David?

01:32:57.130 --> 01:33:01.300
- No idea there, but the idea is that,

01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.420
it's always network activity.

01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:06.090
There's always many, many neurons involved

01:33:06.090 --> 01:33:09.280
and yet there's tremendous
specificity in the neurons

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.980
that might or might not be participating

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:13.900
in any distributed
function like that, right?

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:14.930
So you have to get your mind

01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:17.330
around the fact that
it's both very specific

01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:19.400
and very non-specific at the same time.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:20.630
It's a little tricky to do,

01:33:20.630 --> 01:33:23.100
but I think that's kind
of where the truth lies.

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.580
- Yeah, and so this example

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:29.090
that you mentioned to me
once before about a woman

01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:30.690
who had a stroke in visual cortex,

01:33:30.690 --> 01:33:32.130
I think it speaks to some of this.

01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:33.400
- Right.

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.820
- Could you share with us that story?

01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:39.820
- Sure, so the point is
that, all those of us who see

01:33:40.322 --> 01:33:43.070
have representations of the visual world

01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:44.720
in our visual cortex.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.720
What happens to somebody
when they become blind

01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:53.523
because of problems in the
eye, the retina perhaps?

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.480
You have a big chunk of the cortex,

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.580
this really valuable [indistinct]
for neural processing

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:05.070
that has come to expect
input from the visual system

01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:06.229
and there isn't any anymore.

01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:08.990
So you might think about
that as fallow land, right?

01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:12.917
It's just used by the nervous system

01:34:12.917 --> 01:34:13.970
and that would be a pity,

01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:16.663
but it turns out that it is in fact used.

01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:21.770
And the the case that you're
talking about is of a woman

01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:26.770
who was blind from very early in her life

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.450
and who had risen through the ranks

01:34:30.450 --> 01:34:33.750
to a very high level
executive secretarial position

01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:35.373
in a major corporation.

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.630
And she was extremely
good at braille reading

01:34:38.630 --> 01:34:39.790
and she had a braille typewriter

01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:41.980
and that's how everything was done.

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:46.100
And apparently, she had a stroke
and was discovered at work,

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:48.450
collapsed and brought her to the hospital.

01:34:48.450 --> 01:34:52.000
And apparently, the
neurologist who saw her

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.107
when she finally came to said,

01:34:54.107 --> 01:34:56.210
"I've got good news and bad news."

01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:57.950
Bad news is you've had a stroke,

01:34:57.950 --> 01:35:00.260
the good news is that it
was in an area of your brain

01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:03.070
you're not even using
it's your visual cortex

01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:04.590
and I know you're blind from birth

01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:06.550
so there shouldn't be any issue here."

01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:09.993
The problem was, she lost
her ability to read braille.

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:13.490
So what appears to have been the case

01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:16.390
and this has been confirmed in other ways

01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:19.150
by imaging experiments in humans is that,

01:35:19.150 --> 01:35:22.020
in people who are blind
from very early in birth,

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:25.280
the visual cortex gets repurposed

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.770
as a center for processing
tactile information.

01:35:28.770 --> 01:35:31.560
And especially if you train
to be a good braille reader,

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.730
you're actually reallocating
somehow that real estate

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:37.131
to your fingertips.

01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:40.260
A part of the cortex that
should be listening to the eyes.

01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.450
So that's an extreme level of plasticity.

01:35:42.450 --> 01:35:45.760
But what it shows, is the visual cortex

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.770
is kind of a general
purpose processing machine,

01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:51.527
it's good at spatial information

01:35:51.527 --> 01:35:55.070
and the skin of your fingers
is just another spatial sense

01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:59.630
and deprived of any other input
the brain seems smart enough

01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:02.550
if you want to put it
that way to rewire itself

01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:05.660
to use that real estate
for something useful,

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:07.163
in this case, reading braille.

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:10.380
- Incredible, somewhat
tragic, but incredible.

01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:12.300
At least in that case tragic, yeah.

01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:14.110
- Very informative.
- Very informative.

01:36:14.110 --> 01:36:15.640
And of course it can go the other way too.

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:16.473
- Right.

01:36:16.473 --> 01:36:20.220
- Where people can gain function
in particular modalities

01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:22.690
like improved hearing or tactile function

01:36:22.690 --> 01:36:24.440
in the absence of vision.
- Right.

01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:30.470
- Tell us about connectomes,
we hear about genomes,

01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:34.324
proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms

01:36:34.324 --> 01:36:36.940
these days.
- Yeah.

01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:39.400
- What's a connectome
and why is it valuable?

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:42.760
- Yeah, so the connectome
actually now has two meanings.

01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:47.422
So I'll only refer to one
that is my passion right now.

01:36:47.422 --> 01:36:50.140
And that is really trying
to understand the structure

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:55.140
of nervous tissue at a scale
that's very, very fine.

01:36:58.130 --> 01:36:59.200
- Smaller than a millimeter.

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:02.680
- Way smaller than a
millimeter, a nanometer or less,

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.573
as that's 1,000 times smaller,

01:37:05.966 --> 01:37:10.966
or it's actually a million times smaller.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.100
So really, really tiny

01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:16.090
on the scale of individual synapses

01:37:16.090 --> 01:37:17.300
between individual neurons

01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:20.440
or even smaller like the
individual synaptic vesicles

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.260
containing little packets
of neurotransmitter

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:24.710
they're going to get it
released to allow one neuron

01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:26.370
to communicate to the next.

01:37:26.370 --> 01:37:31.370
So very, very fine, but
the notion here is that,

01:37:33.130 --> 01:37:38.130
you're doing this section after
section at very fine scale.

01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:41.860
So in theory what you have
is a complete description

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:46.280
of a chunk of nervous
tissue that is so complete

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.060
that if you took enough time to identify

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.860
where the boundaries of all the cells are,

01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:52.360
you could come up with
a complete description

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.780
of the synaptic wiring of
that chunk of nervous tissue

01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:56.820
because you have a complete description

01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:58.990
of where all the cells are
and where all the synapses

01:37:58.990 --> 01:38:00.400
between where all the cells are.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.710
So now you essentially
have a wiring diagram

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:04.690
of this complicated piece of tissue.

01:38:04.690 --> 01:38:08.560
So the omics part is
the exhaustiveness of it

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.290
rather than looking at
a couple of synapses

01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:13.890
that are interesting to you
from two different cell types.

01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:17.770
You're looking at all the
synapses of all of the cell types

01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:22.690
which of course is this massive
avalanche of data, right?

01:38:22.690 --> 01:38:24.340
- So in genetics, you have genetics

01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:25.380
and then you have genomics

01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.050
which is the idea of
getting the whole genome.

01:38:27.050 --> 01:38:27.883
- All of it.

01:38:27.883 --> 01:38:30.910
- And we don't really have an
analogous word for genetics,

01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:33.091
but it would be connectivity
and [indistinct].

01:38:33.091 --> 01:38:38.070
- Right.
[indistinct]

01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:40.330
- Right, so it's wanting it all

01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:42.680
and of course it's crazy ambitious,

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:45.240
but that's where it gets fun.

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:48.530
Really it's a use of electron microscopy,

01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:53.480
a very high resolution
microscopic imaging system

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.900
on a new scale with way more payoff

01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:58.680
in terms of understanding the connectivity

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:01.530
of the nervous system
and it's just emerging,

01:39:01.530 --> 01:39:04.290
but I really think it's going
to revolutionize the field

01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:07.230
because we're going to be
able to query these circuits

01:39:07.230 --> 01:39:09.900
how do they actually do
it, look at the hardware

01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:12.430
in a way that's never
been possible before.

01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:14.550
- The the way that I
describe this to people

01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:17.300
is if you were to take a
chunk of kind of cooked

01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:20.220
but cold spaghetti.
- Right.

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:23.830
- And slice it up very thin
you're trying to connect up

01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:28.100
each image of each slice of
the edge of the spaghetti

01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:30.070
as figure out which ropes of spaghetti

01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.903
belong to which.

01:39:30.903 --> 01:39:32.230
- And have a complete description

01:39:32.230 --> 01:39:33.460
of where this piece of spaghetti

01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:34.466
touches that piece of spaghetti

01:39:34.466 --> 01:39:36.740
is there's something
special there obviously.

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:38.690
- Meat sauces and all the other cell types

01:39:38.690 --> 01:39:43.690
and the pesto where it all
is around the spaghetti

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.580
because those are the other
cells, the blood vessels

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:47.030
and the glial cells.

01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:50.700
And so, what's it good for?

01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:55.364
Maps are great, I always think
of connectomics and genomics

01:39:55.364 --> 01:39:59.070
and proteomics, et cetera as necessary,

01:39:59.070 --> 01:40:01.030
but not sufficient.
- Right.

01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:03.840
Right, so I mean in many cases
what you do is you go out

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.890
and probe the function

01:40:05.890 --> 01:40:07.990
and you understand how the
brain does the function

01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:10.920
by finding neurons that seem to be firing

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:14.090
in association with this
function that you're observing.

01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:15.700
And little by little
you're work your way in

01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.300
and now you want to know
what the conductivity is

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.730
maybe the anatomy could help you.

01:40:19.730 --> 01:40:21.550
But this connectomics approach

01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:23.660
or at least the serial electron microscopy

01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:27.230
reconstruction of neurons approach,

01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:29.938
really is allowing us to frame questions

01:40:29.938 --> 01:40:33.450
starting from the anatomy and saying,

01:40:33.450 --> 01:40:35.130
I see a synaptic circuit here,

01:40:35.130 --> 01:40:38.010
my prediction would be that
these cell types would interact

01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:40.160
in a particular way, is that right?

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.200
And then you can go and
probe the physiology

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:43.760
and you might be right
or you might be wrong.

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.830
But more often than not,
it looks like the structure

01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:48.780
is pointing us in the right direction.

01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:53.510
So in my case, I'm using this
to try to understand a circuit

01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:56.150
that is involved in this
image stabilization network

01:40:56.150 --> 01:41:00.250
we're talking about, keeping
things stable on the retina

01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:02.540
and this thing will only respond

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:04.307
at certain speeds of motion.

01:41:04.307 --> 01:41:06.040
These cells in the circuit

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.867
like slow motion they won't
respond to fast motion,

01:41:08.867 --> 01:41:10.330
how does that come about?

01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:14.040
Well, I was able to probe the circuitry,

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:15.500
I knew what my cells looked like,

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:17.116
I could see which other
cells were talking to it,

01:41:17.116 --> 01:41:19.080
I could categorize all the cells

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.580
that might be the players here

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:23.540
that are involved in this
mechanism of tuning the thing

01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:25.530
for slow speeds,

01:41:25.530 --> 01:41:27.870
and then we said it looks
like it's that cell type

01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:30.814
and we went and looked
and the data bore that up.

01:41:30.814 --> 01:41:33.340
But the anatomy drove the search

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:34.510
for the particular cell type

01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:36.890
because we could see it
connected in the right place

01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:38.020
to the right cells.

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:40.090
So creates the hypothesis

01:41:40.090 --> 01:41:42.620
that lets you go query the physiology,

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:44.010
but it can go the other way as well.

01:41:44.010 --> 01:41:46.120
So it's always the synergy
between these functional

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.120
and structural approaches
it gives you the most lift.

01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:53.680
But in many cases,

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.650
the anatomy has been a little
bit the weak sister in this.

01:41:56.650 --> 01:41:59.120
The structure trying
to work out the diagram

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:00.900
because we haven't had the methods.

01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:02.680
Now the methods exist

01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:05.740
and this whole field is
expanding very quickly,

01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.815
because people want these circuit diagrams

01:42:07.815 --> 01:42:10.910
for the particular part
of the nervous system

01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:12.410
that they're working on.

01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:14.310
If you don't know the cell
types and the connections,

01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:17.420
how do you really understand
how the machine works?

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:18.850
- Yeah, what I love about is,

01:42:18.850 --> 01:42:19.877
we don't know what we don't know.

01:42:19.877 --> 01:42:20.710
- Right.

01:42:20.710 --> 01:42:23.890
- And scientists we don't ask
questions, we pose hypotheses.

01:42:23.890 --> 01:42:26.260
Hypotheses being of course some prediction

01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:28.900
that you wager your time on basically.

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.980
- Right.
- And it either turns out

01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:35.930
to be true or not true,
but if you don't know

01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:37.610
that a particular cell type is there,

01:42:37.610 --> 01:42:42.610
you could never in any
configuration of life or a career

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:47.790
or exploration of a nervous
system wager a hypothesis

01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:49.340
because you didn't know it was there.

01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:50.460
So this allows you to say ah,

01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:52.950
there's a little interesting
little connection

01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:55.030
between this cell that
I know is interesting

01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:57.640
in another cell that's a little
mysterious but interesting,

01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.080
I'm going to hypothesize
that it's doing blank,

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:01.310
blank and blank and go test that.

01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:03.450
And in the absence of these connectomes,

01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:05.150
you would never know that
that cell was lurking there

01:43:05.150 --> 01:43:06.623
in the shadows.

01:43:06.623 --> 01:43:08.300
- Right, right, yeah.

01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:09.650
And if you're just trying to understand

01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:13.884
how information flows through
this biological machine,

01:43:13.884 --> 01:43:16.370
you want to know where things are.

01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:18.640
Neurotransmitters are
dumped out of the terminals

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.890
of one cell and they
diffuse across the space

01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:24.285
between the two cells which
is kind of a liquidy space

01:43:24.285 --> 01:43:26.710
and they hit some receptors
on the postsynaptic cell

01:43:26.710 --> 01:43:28.063
and they have some impact.

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.410
Sometimes that's not
through a regular synapse,

01:43:31.410 --> 01:43:33.100
sometimes it's through a neuromodulator

01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.840
like you often talk about on your podcast

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:36.673
that are sort of.

01:43:36.673 --> 01:43:38.220
- Dopamine.
- Dopamine, exactly.

01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:40.530
Oozing into the space between the cells

01:43:40.530 --> 01:43:42.700
and it may be acting at some distance

01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:45.030
far from where it was released, right?

01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:47.200
But if you don't know where
the release is happening

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:48.140
and where other things

01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:49.870
are that might respond to that release

01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:52.162
you're groping around in the dark.

01:43:52.162 --> 01:43:54.110
- Well, I love that you are doing this

01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:58.420
and I have to share
with the listeners that,

01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:00.113
the first time I ever met David

01:44:00.113 --> 01:44:03.230
and every time I've ever
met with him in-person

01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:06.240
at least at his laboratory at Brown,

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:08.750
he was in his office, door closed,

01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:10.937
drawing neurons and their connections.

01:44:10.937 --> 01:44:11.770
[laughs]

01:44:11.770 --> 01:44:13.160
And this is somewhat unusual

01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:16.930
for somebody who's a endowed
full professor or chairman

01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:19.240
of the department et cetera for many years

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.910
to be doing the hands-on work.

01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:22.770
Typically, that's the stuff
that's done by technicians

01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:24.180
or graduate students or postdocs.

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:26.090
But I think it's fair to say

01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:29.760
that you really love
looking at nervous systems

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:33.180
and drawing the accurate renditions

01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:35.590
of how those nervous systems are organized

01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:37.330
and thinking about how they work.

01:44:37.330 --> 01:44:38.810
- Yeah, it's pure joy for me.

01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:41.225
I mean, I'm a very visual
person, my wife is an artist,

01:44:41.225 --> 01:44:43.550
we look a lot of art together

01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:47.580
just the forms of things are
gorgeous in their own right.

01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:51.290
But to know that the form
is in a sense the function

01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:55.560
that the architecture of the connectivity

01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:59.470
is how the computation happens
in the brain at some level

01:44:59.470 --> 01:45:02.850
even though we don't fully
understand that in most contexts,

01:45:02.850 --> 01:45:04.978
gives me great joy 'cause
I'm working on something

01:45:04.978 --> 01:45:09.499
that's both visually beautiful
but also deeply beautiful

01:45:09.499 --> 01:45:14.499
in a sort of a higher
sort of knowledge context,

01:45:15.389 --> 01:45:16.750
what is it all about.

01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:20.040
- I love it, well, as a final question,

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:22.520
I get asked very often about how people

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.183
should learn about neuroscience,

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.160
or how they should go about
pursuing maybe an education

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:30.330
in neuroscience if they're
at that stage of their life

01:45:30.330 --> 01:45:34.070
or that's appropriate for
their current trajectory.

01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:36.936
Do you have any advice to
young people, old people,

01:45:36.936 --> 01:45:39.730
anything in between about how to learn

01:45:39.730 --> 01:45:42.520
about the nervous system more
maybe in a more formal way?

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:43.890
I mean obviously, we have our podcast,

01:45:43.890 --> 01:45:46.810
there are other sources of
neuroscience information

01:45:46.810 --> 01:45:48.610
out there, but for the young person

01:45:48.610 --> 01:45:51.610
who thinks they want to
understand the brain,

01:45:51.610 --> 01:45:55.120
they want to learn about the
brain, what should we tell them?

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:56.370
- Well, that's a great question.

01:45:56.370 --> 01:45:57.880
And there's so many sources out there.

01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:58.950
It's almost a question

01:45:58.950 --> 01:46:01.723
of how do you deal with this
avalanche of information

01:46:01.723 --> 01:46:04.635
out there, I think your podcast
is a great way for people

01:46:04.635 --> 01:46:08.250
to learn more about the nervous
system in an accessible way.

01:46:08.250 --> 01:46:09.760
But there's so much stuff out there

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:10.593
and it's not just that.

01:46:10.593 --> 01:46:13.870
I mean, the resources are
becoming more and more available

01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:18.580
for average folks to participate
in neuroscience research

01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:19.413
on some level.

01:46:19.413 --> 01:46:21.108
There's this famous Eyewire
project of Sebastian.

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:23.260
- Oh yeah, maybe you let us about Eyewire.

01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:26.243
- Yeah, so that's connectomics
and that's a situation

01:46:26.243 --> 01:46:29.210
where a very clever scientist realized

01:46:29.210 --> 01:46:33.820
that the physical work of
doing all this reconstruction

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:37.230
of neurons from these
electron micro-graphs,

01:46:37.230 --> 01:46:39.920
there's a lot of time involved.

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:42.400
Many, many person hours
have to go into that

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.760
to come up with the map that you want

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:47.330
of where the cells are,
and he was very clever

01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:49.240
about setting up a context

01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:51.360
in which he could crowdsource this

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.193
and people who were interested

01:46:52.193 --> 01:46:54.760
in getting a little experience
looking at nervous tissue

01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:57.077
and participating in a research project

01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:59.413
could learn how to do
this and do a little bit.

01:46:59.413 --> 01:47:01.860
- From their living room.
- From their living room.

01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:04.610
- We'll put a link to Eyewire,
it also is a great bridge

01:47:04.610 --> 01:47:06.420
between what we were just
talking about connectomics

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:08.500
and actually participating in research.

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:09.333
- Right.

01:47:09.333 --> 01:47:10.650
- And you don't need a graduate mentor

01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:12.790
or anything like that.
- Right.

01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:13.867
So more of this is coming

01:47:13.867 --> 01:47:17.340
and I'm actually interested
in building more of this

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.160
so that people who are interested,

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:21.570
want to participate at some level

01:47:21.570 --> 01:47:24.520
don't necessarily have
the time or resources

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.799
to get involved in laboratory research

01:47:26.799 --> 01:47:29.900
can get exposed to it and participate

01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:34.335
and actually contribute, so
I think that's one thing.

01:47:34.335 --> 01:47:37.897
I mean, just asking questions
of the people around you

01:47:37.897 --> 01:47:39.400
who know a little bit more

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:41.220
and have them point you
in the right direction.

01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:42.620
Here's a book you might like to read,

01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:45.840
there's lots of great
popular books out there

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:48.750
that are accessible that
will give you some more sense

01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:51.990
of the full range of what's
out there in the neurosciences.

01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:54.390
- We can put some links to
a few of those that we like.

01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:56.120
- Right.
- On basic neuroscience.

01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:56.953
- Right.
- Our good friend

01:47:56.953 --> 01:47:59.570
Dick Masland, the late Richard,

01:47:59.570 --> 01:48:02.333
people call him Dick
Masland had a good book.

01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:05.118
I forget the title at the moment.

01:48:05.118 --> 01:48:08.681
It's sitting behind me somewhere
over there on the shelf

01:48:08.681 --> 01:48:10.440
about vision and how nervous systems work.

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.570
A pretty accessible book
for the general public.

01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:13.403
- Right
- Yeah.

01:48:13.403 --> 01:48:16.580
- Right, so that, and there's
so many sources out there.

01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:18.110
I mean, Wikipedia is a great way.

01:48:18.110 --> 01:48:20.130
If you have a particular
question about visual function,

01:48:20.130 --> 01:48:22.431
I would say by all means,
head to Wikipedians

01:48:22.431 --> 01:48:25.550
and get the first look

01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:27.560
and follow the the references from there,

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:31.330
or go to your library,
or there's so many ways

01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:33.950
to get into it, it's such
an exciting field now.

01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:34.783
There's so many,

01:48:34.783 --> 01:48:37.490
I mean, any particular
realm that's special to you,

01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:41.193
your experience, your
strengths, your passions,

01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:45.450
there's a field of
neuroscience devoted to that.

01:48:45.450 --> 01:48:47.880
If you know somebody who's
got a neurological problem

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:51.870
or a psychiatric problem,
there's a branch of neuroscience

01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:54.640
that is devoted to
trying to understand that

01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.483
and to solve these kinds
of problems down the line.

01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:03.380
So feel the buzz, it's an
exciting time to get involved.

01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:05.670
- Great, those are great
resources that people can access

01:49:05.670 --> 01:49:08.780
from anywhere zero-cost as you
need an internet connection.

01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:11.047
But aside from that, we'll
put the links to some.

01:49:11.047 --> 01:49:13.817
And I'm remembering,
Dick's book is called,

01:49:13.817 --> 01:49:15.280
"We Know It When We See It."

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.970
- Right, one of my heroes.

01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:18.500
- Yeah, a wonderful colleague

01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:20.100
who unfortunately we lost a few years ago.

01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:24.170
But listen David, this has been wonderful.

01:49:24.170 --> 01:49:25.003
- It's been a blast.

01:49:25.003 --> 01:49:26.820
- We really appreciate you
taking the time to do this

01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:29.310
as people probably realize by now

01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:31.040
you're an incredible wealth of knowledge

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:32.970
about the entire nervous system,

01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:35.240
today we just hit this top contour

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.370
of a number of different areas

01:49:36.370 --> 01:49:38.340
to give a flavor of the different ways

01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:41.030
that the nervous system
works and is organized

01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:43.350
and how that's put together,

01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:45.230
how these areas are
talking to one another.

01:49:45.230 --> 01:49:46.063
What I love about you

01:49:46.063 --> 01:49:47.889
is that you're such an incredible educator

01:49:47.889 --> 01:49:50.460
and I've taught so many
students over the years.

01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:54.210
But also for me personally as friends,

01:49:54.210 --> 01:49:57.850
but also any time that I want
to touch into the the beauty

01:49:57.850 --> 01:50:00.750
of the nervous system, I
rarely lose touch with it.

01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:02.140
But anytime I want to touch into it

01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:03.920
and start thinking about new problems

01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:06.490
and ways that the nervous
system is doing things

01:50:06.490 --> 01:50:08.360
that I hadn't thought about, I call you.

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.770
So please forgive me for the
calls past, present and future

01:50:12.770 --> 01:50:13.603
unless you change your number.

01:50:13.603 --> 01:50:16.190
And even if you do, I'll be calling.

01:50:16.190 --> 01:50:18.213
- It's been such a blast Andy.

01:50:18.213 --> 01:50:21.030
This has been a great session

01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:22.660
and it's always fun talking to you.

01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:27.660
It always gets my brain
racing, so thank you.

01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:29.920
- Thank you, thank you
for joining me today

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:32.330
for my discussion with Dr. David Berson.

01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:35.220
By now, you should have a
much clearer understanding

01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:38.240
of how the brain is
organized and how it works

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.800
to do all the incredible
things that it does.

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.240

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:21.600
While today's discussion did
not focus on supplements,

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.240
many previous podcast episodes

01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.220
include discussions about supplements.

01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:28.240
And while supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:31.100
many people derive benefit
from them for things like sleep

01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:33.930
or focus or anxiety relief and so on.

01:51:33.930 --> 01:51:36.150
One issue with the
supplement industry however,

01:51:36.150 --> 01:51:38.060
is that oftentimes the quality

01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:40.590
will really vary across brands.

01:51:40.590 --> 01:51:43.080
That's why we partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.560
because Thorne supplements

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:46.270
are of the absolute highest standards

01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:48.540
in terms of the quality of
the ingredients that include

01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:50.640
and the precision of the
amounts of the ingredients

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:51.990
they include, in other words,

01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:53.130
what's listed on the bottle,

01:51:53.130 --> 01:51:54.900
is what's actually found in the bottle,

01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:57.080
which is not true of many
supplements out there

01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:58.280
that have been tested.

01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:00.120
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:04.990
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:07.000
and there you can see the
supplements that I take

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.610
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements.

01:52:09.610 --> 01:52:11.710
And if you navigate deeper
into the Thorne site

01:52:11.710 --> 01:52:15.680
through that portal thorne.com/u/huberman,

01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.610
you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements

01:52:18.610 --> 01:52:20.080
that Thorne happens to make.

01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:21.830
If you're not already
following Huberman Lab

01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:24.770
on Instagram and Twitter,
feel free to do so.

01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:27.900
Both places I regularly
post short video posts,

01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:31.230
or text posts that give
tools related to health

01:52:31.230 --> 01:52:32.850
and neuroscience and so forth.

01:52:32.850 --> 01:52:34.210
And most of the time,

01:52:34.210 --> 01:52:36.460
that information is non-overlapping
with the information

01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:37.293
on the podcast.

01:52:37.293 --> 01:52:39.720
Again, it's just Huberman
Lab on Instagram and Twitter.

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:41.290
And last but not least,

01:52:41.290 --> 01:52:42.655
thank you for your interest in science.

01:52:42.655 --> 01:52:45.238
