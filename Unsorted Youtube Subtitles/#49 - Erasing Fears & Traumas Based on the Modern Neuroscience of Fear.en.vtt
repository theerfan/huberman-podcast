00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.880
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.289
for everyday life.

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:09.260
[bright music]

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.200
- I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.000
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.820
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.808
Today, we're going to talk
about the Neuroscience of fear.

00:00:17.808 --> 00:00:20.510
We are also going to talk about trauma

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.400
and post-traumatic stress disorders.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.100
The Neuroscience of fear has
a long history in biology

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.590
and in the field of psychology.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.440
However, I think it's fair to
say that in the last 10 years,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.600
the field of Neuroscience has
shed light on not just the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.590
neural circuits, meaning
the areas of the brain

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.080
that control the fear response
and the ways that it does it,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.100
but some important ways
to extinguish fears

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.830
using behavioral
therapies, drug therapies,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.330
and what we call brain machine interfaces.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.680
Today, we are going to
talk about all of those,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.440
and you're going to come away
with both an understanding

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.930
of the biology of fear and trauma,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.430
as well as many practical tools
to confront fear and trauma.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.850
In fact, we are going to discuss

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.470
one very recently published study

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.860
in which five minutes a day

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.600
of deliberate exposure to stress

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.030
was shown to alleviate
longstanding depressive

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.980
and fear related symptoms.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.520
We will get into the details
of that study and the protocol

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.970
that emerges from that study
a little later in the podcast.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.430
But it stands as a
really important somewhat

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.960
counter-intuitive example of
how stress itself can be used

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.470
to combat fear.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.550
To give you a sense of where we are going,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.210
I'll just lay out the
framework for today's podcast.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.160
First, I'm going to teach
you about the biology of fear

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.340
and trauma.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.750
Literally the cells and circuits
and connections in the body

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.170
and chemicals in the body that
give rise to the so-called

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.400
fear response.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.400
And why sometimes, but not
always fear can turn into trauma.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.270
I will also describe the
biology of how fear is unlearned

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.120
or what we call extinguished.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.720
And there too, you're going
to get some serious surprises.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.960
You're going to learn for instance,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.840
that we can't just eliminate fears.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.700
We actually have to replace
fears with a new positive event.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.020
And again, there are tools
with which to do that,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.000
and I will teach you those tools today.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.680
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.600
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.540
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.140
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.880
and science related tools
to the general public.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.890
In keeping with that theme,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.660
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.930
Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.520
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.950
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.160
I've been taking Athletic
Greens every day since 2012.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.570
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.370
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.320
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.410
is that it covers all
of my vitamin mineral

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.160
and probiotic needs.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.230
Nowadays, there's a lot of data out there

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.900
pointing to the fact that
a healthy gut microbiome,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.940
literally little microbes
that live in our gut

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.380
that are good for us
is important to support

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.310
our immune system, our nervous
system, our endocrine system,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.600
and various aspects of our
immediate and long-term health.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.433
With Athletic Greens,

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:09.490
I get all the vitamins
and minerals that I need.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.190
Plus the probiotics ensure
a healthy gut microbiome.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.300
It also tastes really good.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.570
I mix mine up with some water,
a little bit of lemon juice.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.900
I'll have that early in the day,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.400
and sometimes a second time
later in the day as well.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.250
It's compatible with intermittent fasting,

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.750
it's compatible with vegan diets,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.850
with keto diets and essentially every diet

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.520
that you could possibly imagine out there.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.840
It's also filled with
adaptogens for recovery.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.700
It has digestive enzymes for gut health

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.230
and has a number of
other things that support

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.203
the immune system.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.570
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.100
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.600
to claim their special offer.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.120
They'll give you five free travel packs

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.990
that make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.100
while you're on the road.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.610
And they'll give you a year
supply of Vitamin D3 K2.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.460
There's now a lot of
evidence that vitamin D3

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.180
supports a huge number
of metabolic factors,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.310
immune system factors, endocrine factors.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.010
Basically we need vitamin D3.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.370
We can get it from the sun,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.860
but many people are
deficient in vitamin D3

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.760
even if they are getting what they think

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.960
is sufficient sunlight.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.390
And K2 is important for
cardiovascular health.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.280
So again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.800
You can claim their special offer,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.990
the five free travel packs

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.830
plus the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.107
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

00:04:22.107 --> 00:04:24.520
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.950
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.470
to help you better understand your body

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.390
and help you reach your health goals.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.310
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.420
for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.410
your immediate and long-term
health can only be analyzed

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.760
from a quality blood test.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.250
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.840
you can also get information
about how your specific genes

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.400
are impacting your immediate
and long-term health.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.890
Now a problem with a lot of blood tests

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.360
and DNA tests out there is
you get the numbers back

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.370
but you don't know what
to do with those numbers.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.070
With InsideTracker,
they make it very simple

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.290
to figure out what to do
to bring those numbers

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.240
into the ranges that are right for you.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.970
They have a dashboard
that's very easy to use.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.440
You can see the numbers from
your blood and or DNA tests.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.090
And it will point to
specific lifestyle factors,

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.930
nutritional factors, as
well as supplementation,

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.360
maybe even prescription factors

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.060
that would be right for you to
bring the numbers into range

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.520
that are ideal for your immediate

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.020
and long-term health goals.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.700
Another feature that InsideTracker has

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.590
is their inner age test.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.850
This test shows you what
your biological age is

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.160
and compares that to
your chronological age

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.880
and what you can do to
improve your biological age,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.770
which of course is the important number.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.130
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.740

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.550
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.610
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.220
that are of the absolute highest quality.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.710
I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.140
for close to a year now,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.220
and it's the best sleep
that I've ever had.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.020
Helix has a quiz that takes
about two minutes to complete

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.800
and matches your body
type and sleep preferences

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.620
to the perfect mattress for you.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.830
Some people sleep on their side,

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.960
some people sleep on their backs,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.220
some people sleep on their stomach.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.190
Some people run hot, some people run cold.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.230
Some people don't know
which part of their body

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.410
they sleep on.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.800
You take this test, it's
very brief, two minutes.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.280
And after that test Helix we'll match you

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.210
to the mattress that's ideal for you.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.040
I match to the so-called
Dusk, D-U-S-K mattress,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.190
because I wanted a mattress
that wasn't too firm,

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.050
not too soft.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.270
And I like to sleep sort of on my stomach

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.530
and kind of a crawling soldier position.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.950
That seems to be always how I
wake up in the morning anyway.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.690
So if you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.020
go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.290
take their two minutes sleep quiz

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.040
and they'll match it to
a customized mattress

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.470
and you'll get up to $200
off all mattress orders

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.290
and you'll get two free pillows.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.520
Again, if you're interested,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.250
please go to helixsleep.com/huberman
for up to $200 off

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.800
and two free pillows.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.670
So what is fear?

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.930
Well, fear falls into a category

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.220
of nervous system phenomenon
that we can reliably call

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.660
an emotion.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.020
And it is hotly debated nowadays.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.550
And it's been hotly debated
really for centuries

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.820
what an emotion is and
what an emotion isn't.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.150
Now that's not a debate that
I want to get into today.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.350
I think it's fair to say
that emotions include

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.550
responses within our body.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.300
Quickening of heart rate,
changes in blood flow,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.070
things that we experience as a warming

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.600
or a cooling of our skin.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.910
But that there's also
a cognitive component.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.080
There are thoughts, there are memories.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.310
There's all sorts of stuff
that goes on in our mind

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.860
and in our body that
together we call an emotion.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.220
And there's a vast amount of
interest in literature devoted

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.090
to try and understand how many
different emotions there are,

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.420
how different people experience emotions.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.970
And that's certainly a
topic that we will embrace

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.890
in a future podcast episode.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.070
But today I just want to talk
about fear as a response.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.750
Because when we talk about fear
as a physiological response

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.760
and as a cognitive response,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.920
then we can get down to some
very concrete mechanisms

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.100
and some very concrete and practical tools

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.830
that can be used to deal with
fear when fear is not wanted.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.833
So let's talk first about what fear isn't.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.820
Most people are familiar with stress,

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.930
both as a concept and as an experience.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.540
Stress is a physiological response.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.390
It involves quickening of the heart rate.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.730
Typically quickening a breathing,

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.590
blood flow getting
shuttled to certain areas

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.840
of the brain and body and not to others.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.140
It can create a hypervigilance
or an awareness.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.350
Typically that awareness is narrower,

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.160
literally narrower in space,

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.050
like a soda straw view of the world

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.310
than when we are relaxed.

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.740
And it is fair to say
that we cannot have fear

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.940
without having several,

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.150
if not all of the elements
of the stress response.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.223
However, we can have
stress without having fear.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.270
Likewise, people are
familiar with the phrase

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.510
or the word rather, anxiety.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.690
Anxiety tends to be stress
about some future event,

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.550
although it can mean other things as well.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.470
We can't really have fear
without seeing or observing

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.360
or experiencing some of
the elements of anxiety,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.183
but we can have anxiety
without having fear.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.300
So what you're starting to
realize is that fear is built up

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.600
from certain basic elements
that include stress and anxiety.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.700
And then there is trauma.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.380
And trauma also requires a specific,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.090
what we will call operational definition.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.760
An operational definition is
just a definition that allows

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.610
us to have a conversation
because we both agree on

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.180
or mostly agree on what the
meaning of a given word is.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.810
It makes conversations much easier.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.130
In fact, I would argue if we
all had operational definitions

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.570
for more things in the world,

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.120
that there would be fewer
misunderstandings and arguments

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.410
and we'd all move a lot
further as a species.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.890
But that's another topic entirely.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.620
The operational definition of trauma

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.010
is that some fear took place,

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.550
which of course includes
stress and anxiety.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.830
And that fear somehow gets embedded

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.750
or activated in our nervous system,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.160
such that it shows up at
times when it's maladaptive.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.130
Meaning that fear doesn't serve us well

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.980
and it gets reactivated at various times.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.030
Like when you first
wake up in the morning,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.150
if you're not in the presence
of something that scared you,

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.860
but you suddenly have what
feels like a panic attack

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.300
and you're in deep fear.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.970
Well, that's post-traumatic stress.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.040
That's post-traumatic fear.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.500
So I don't want to get bogged down

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.980
too much in the nomenclature

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.030
but what I'm doing here is building up

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.380
a sort of a series of layers
where stress and anxiety

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.270
form the foundation of what
we're calling fear and trauma.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.870
And then there are other phrases out there

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.080
that we would be remiss if
we didn't mention things

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.230
like phobias and panic attacks.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.980
Panic attacks are the
experience of extreme fear

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.050
but without any fear inducing stimulus.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.030
So it's kind of like trauma.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:05.030
And a phobia tends to be extreme
fear of something specific.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.400
Fear of spiders, fear of
heights, fear of flying,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.680
fear of dying, these
kinds of things, okay?

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.690
The reason for laying all that
out there is not to create

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.010
a word soup to confuse us rather
it is to simplify the issue

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.580
because now that we
acknowledge that there are many

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.150
different phrases to describe
this thing that we call fear

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.050
and unrelated phenomenon.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.000
We can start to just focus
on two of these issues,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.610
fear and trauma.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.750
As it relates to specific
biological processes,

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.890
specific cognitive processes.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.150
And we can start to dissect
how fears are formed,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.890
how fears are unformed
and how new memories

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.960
can come to replace previously
fearful experiences.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.140
So in this effort to
establish a common language

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.000
around fear and trauma,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.170
I want to point out autonomic arousal.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.590
Autonomic arousal relates to this aspect

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.500
of our nervous system,

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.140
that we call the autonomic nervous system.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.310
Autonomic means automatic
that somewhat of a misnomer,

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.540
because there are aspects of
your autonomic nervous system

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.880
that you can control.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.240
But your autonomic nervous
system controls things like

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.240
digestion, urination,
sexual behavior, stress.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.830
When you want to be awake,
when you want to be asleep,

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.240
it basically has two branches to it.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.240
Two branches, meaning
two different systems.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.460
One is the so-called sympathetic
autonomic nervous system.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.840
Has nothing to do with sympathy,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.480
it has everything to do
with increasing alertness.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.510
Think of the sympathetic nervous system

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.030
as the alertness nervous system.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.470
It's what ramps up your
levels of alertness,

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.010
ramps up your levels of vigilant.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.860
Think about it as the
accelerator on your alertness

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.693
and attention.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.120
The other branch of the
autonomic nervous system

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.960
is the so-called,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.500
parasympathetic branch of
the autonomic nervous system.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.070
I know that's a mouthful.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.840
The parasympathetic branch of
the autonomic nervous system

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.000
are the cells and neurons and chemicals

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.160
and other aspects of your brain and body

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.330
that are involved in the
calming nervous system.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.590
So sympathetic is alerting,
parasympathetic is calming.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.470
And it acts as sort of a seesaw

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.650
to adjust your overall level of alertness.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.640
So for instance, right now I'm alert,

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.160
but I feel pretty calm.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.307
I'm not ready to go to
sleep or anything like that.

00:13:11.307 --> 00:13:13.180
I don't feel like I need a nap.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.760
I'm alert, but I'm calm.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.600
I'm not in a state of stress or panic.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.870
So that seesaw we could
imagine is more or less level.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.810
Maybe it's tilted up a little bit

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.610
to the side of increased
sympathetic or alertness

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.400
rather than parasympathetic
because I feel wide awake.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.210
If I were sleepy, the
opposite would be true.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.900
The parasympathetic side
would be increased relative

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.100
to the sympathetic side.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.540
There are many different aspects

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.740
of the autonomic nervous system,

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.760
but one of the main aspects is an aspect

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.160
that's going to come up again
and again and again today,

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.050
it's very important that
you understand what it is.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.690
It's called the HPA axis.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:51.690
The HPA axis stands for
Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.110
The hypothalamus is a
collection of neurons.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.470
It's an area of your brain real estate,

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.750
that's deep in the brain
at the base of the brain

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.160
that contains many, many different areas

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.880
that control things like temperature,

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.440
and desire to have sex,
desire to eat, thirst.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.800
It also controls the desire
to not mate, to have sex,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.330
not to eat, not drink more water
or any other type of fluid.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.860
So it has accelerators and
brakes in there as well.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.770
The hypothalamus connects
to the so-called pituitary,

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.530
the pituitary lives close
to the roof of your mouth.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.380
It releases hormones
into your bloodstream.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.810
And so the hypothalamus
has this ability to trigger

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.990
the release or prevent the
release of particular hormones

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.990
like cortisol or the hormones
that go stimulate ovaries

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.110
to produce estrogen or testes
to produce testosterone

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.210
or adrenals to produce Adrenaline.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.110
And speaking of the adrenals
that [indistinct] and the HPA

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.440
are the adrenals.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.840
You have two glands that
sit above your kidneys

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.030
and your lower back.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.550
They receive signals by
way of nerve cells neurons,

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.410
and by way of hormones and other things

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.640
released from the brain
and elsewhere in the body.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.980
And they release different hormones

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.670
and other types of
chemicals into the body.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.010
And the two main ones that
you need to know about today

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:15.010
are Adrenaline also called
Epinephrine and Cortisol.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.210
Both of those are
so-called stress hormones,

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.250
but they're not always involved in stress.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.540
They're also involved in
waking up in the morning

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.020
when you arrive...

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.730
Excuse me, when you rise from sleep.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.170
And so this HPA axis,

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.110
should be thought of in the following way.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.100
The HPA axis includes
a piece of the brain,

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.450
the hypothalamus, the
pituitary, and the adrenals.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.960
So it's a beautiful three part system

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.440
that can use your brain to
alert or wake up your body

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.260
and prepare it for action.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.460
And it can do that in the short term,

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.930
by triggering the release
of hormones and chemicals

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.270
that make you alert and
ready to go right away

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.230
and by triggering the
release of neurotransmitters

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.770
and hormones and other chemicals

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.370
that give that alertness a very long tail,

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.690
a very long latency before it shuts off.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.160
And that's important because
one of the hallmarks of fear

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.560
and one of the hallmarks of trauma

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.880
is that they involve fear
responses that are long lasting.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.487
Even if those fearful events,

00:16:17.327 --> 00:16:20.790
the events in the world
that trigger the HPA axis

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.130
can be very brief, like a
car that almost hits you

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.010
as you step off the curb or something...

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.070
A gunshot that goes off suddenly,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.320
and it's just a very quick,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.620
like, you know, 500
millisecond or 1 second event.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.420
The fear response can
reverberate through your system

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:40.310
because the chemicals that
are involved in this HPA axis

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:44.420
have a fast component and
a longer-lasting component.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.620
And the longer-lasting
component can actually change

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.620
not just the connections of
different areas of the brain

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.990
and the way that our
organs work like our heart

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.120
and the way that we breathe.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.720
It actually can feed back to the brain

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.450
and literally control gene expression.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.560
Which can take many days
and build out new circuits

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.890
and new chemicals that can embed
fear in our brain and body.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.780
And that might sound very
depressing but there's a reason.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.250
And there's an adaptive
reason why there's the slow

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.870
and fast phase of the HPA
axis and the fear response.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.280
And fortunately, that gene expression

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.520
and the long arc of the fear response,

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.210
the way it kind of lives in our system

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.640
kind of like a phantom in some
ways can also be leveraged

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.600
to undo the fear response,

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.330
to extinguish the fear
response and replace it

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.370
with non fearful associations.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.790
So let's dig a little deeper
into the neural circuits

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.760
and biology of fear.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.000
Because in doing that,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.640
we can start to reveal the
logic of how to attack fear

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.653
if that's the goal.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.570
We can't have a discussion about fear

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.000
without discussing the famous amygdala.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.160
Famous because I think most people by now

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.020
have heard of the amygdala.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.690
Amygdala means almond.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.010
It's an almond shaped structure
on both sides of the brain.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.037
So you have one on the
right side of your brain,

00:18:04.037 --> 00:18:06.060
and one on the left side of your brain.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.850
The amygdala is part of what
we can call the threat reflex.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.950
And this is very important
to conceptualize fear

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.180
as including a reflex.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.140
So much as you have
reflexes that cause you

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.520
to lift your foot up
if you are just step on

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.430
something sharp.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.950
You literally have a reflex
within your spinal cord

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.070
that causes you to lift up one
foot and extend the other one

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.903
toward the ground.

00:18:27.903 --> 00:18:29.100
Believe it or not,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.520
you always think you
step on something sharp

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.730
you pull your foot up.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.600
But you actually step on something sharp,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.380
you pull your foot up and in pulling it up

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.350
there's another reflex that's activated

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.140
that as you extend your other legs

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.040
so that you don't fall over.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.160
Similarly in the process
of experiencing fear,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.380
you have a reflex for particular events

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.600
in your brain and body.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.940
And that reflex involves things like,

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.410
quickening of your heart
rate, hypervigilance,

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.040
your attentional systems pop on,

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.040
increased ability to access
energy stores for movement

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.090
and thought and so forth.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:08.410
But just like that step on
the tack reflex example,

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.590
all of the neural circuits
that are associated

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.860
with being calm, with
being able to go to sleep,

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.920
with being able to
visualize the full picture

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.753
of your environment,

00:19:17.753 --> 00:19:20.010
literally to see your entire environment,

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.520
or to hear other things around you.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.270
All of those get shut down when
the so-called threat reflex

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.620
gets activated.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.630
And the amygdala is part
of the threat reflect

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.390
so much so that we can really say,

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.770
that it's the final common pathway

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.420
through which the threat reflex flows.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.253
In other words,

00:19:37.253 --> 00:19:41.050
the amygdala is essential
for the threat response.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.680
But the threat reflex
and the threat response

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.170
is kind of a dumb response.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.010
It's not a sophisticated
thing, it's very generic.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.620
And this is also a very important point.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.770
One of the beauties of the fear system

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.660
is that it's very generalizable.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.330
It's not designed for you to
be afraid of any one thing.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.410
Sure, there are some debates

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.570
and probably some good data out there

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.810
that support the fact that
human babies are innately,

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.200
meaning requires no learning.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.690
Innately afraid of certain
things like heights,

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.330
or snakes or spiders.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.470
There's debate about this.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.733
And they depends on the
quality of the experiment,

00:20:18.733 --> 00:20:19.566
et cetera.

00:20:19.566 --> 00:20:22.300
But the real capacity of the fear system

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.620
is that we can become afraid of anything

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.530
provided that this threat
system is activated

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.590
in conjunction with some
external experience.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.960
So the way I'd like you to
think about the amygdala

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.450
is not as a fear center,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:38.740
but that it's a critical
component of the threat reflex.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.800
I'd like you to also internalize the idea

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.660
that the threat reflex involves

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.420
this activation of certain systems

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.830
and suppression of all the systems

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.400
for calming the parasympathetic system.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.410
And now I'm going to describe
the way that information flows

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.040
into and through this threat reflex.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.290
And in doing that, it will
reveal how specific things,

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.900
like a spider, like a snake,
like a physical trauma,

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.920
like a car accident, like
a fear of public speaking,

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.100
whatever happens to scare
you or scare somebody,

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.790
how that gets attached to this reflex.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.170
Because this reflex is very generic.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.240
It doesn't really know
what to be afraid of.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.520
It only knows how to
create this sensation,

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.870
this internal landscape
that we think of as fear.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.950
So while the amygdala
might look like an almond,

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.440
it's actually part of
a much bigger complex

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.730
or collection of neurons
called the amygdaloid complex.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.790
That complex has anywhere
from 12 to 14 areas

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.130
depending on who's...

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.040
Which neuroanatomist is naming
things and carving it up

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.510
in Neuroscience and in much of biology.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.767
We like to joke that there are lumpers

00:21:44.767 --> 00:21:45.990
and there are splitters.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.550
So some people like to draw boundaries

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.600
between every little distinct difference

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.940
and say, "Oh, that's a separate area

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.773
and other people are lumpers."

00:21:51.773 --> 00:21:54.210
And they say, "Well, listen,
you know why complicate things?

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.580
Let's lump those together."

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.320
I'm neither a lumper nor a splitter,

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.510
I'm somewhere in between.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.420
I think the number 12 is a good number

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.880
in terms of the number of
different areas of the amygdala.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.340
Why is that important to us?

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.410
Well, it turns out that
the amygdala is not just

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.760
a area for threat,

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.150
it's an area for generating
threat reflexes that integrates

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.810
lots of different types of information.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.970
So for those of you that want to know,

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.010
I'm going to give you some
names, some nomenclature,

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.790
for those of you that don't,
you can tune out for this.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.440
But basically information
from our memory systems,

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.500
like the hippocampus and
from our sensory systems,

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.030
our eyes, our ears, our
nose, our mouth, et cetera.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.270
So taste information, vision,

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.340
auditory information, touch, et cetera.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.190
Flow into the so-called lateral
portion of the amygdala.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.023
Flows into...

00:22:42.023 --> 00:22:43.170
Or the amygdaloid complex.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.730
It flows into the lateral portion.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.000
And then there are multiple
outputs from the amygdala.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.720
And this is where things
get particularly interesting

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.690
because the outputs of the amygdala

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.720
have a lot of different areas,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.340
but there are two main pathways.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.850
One involves the hypothalamus,

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.730
which you heard about before
this collection of neurons

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.190
that control a lot of our
primitive drives for sex,

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.190
for food, for thirst and
for warmth, et cetera.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:09.600
And it also feeds out to our adrenals.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.980
Those glands that you learned
about a few minutes ago

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.380
to create a sense of alertness and action.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.800
It also feeds out what I mean
by feeds out, by the way,

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.960
is there are neurons that send wires.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.200
We call those wires axons connections.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.610
Where they can release chemicals
and trigger the activation

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:26.443
of different brain areas.

00:23:26.443 --> 00:23:30.117
So it feeds out to other
brain areas such as the PAG.

00:23:30.117 --> 00:23:33.040
PAG is very interesting
for our discussion today.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.920
It's the periaqueductal gray.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.390
The periaqueductal gray contains neurons

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:42.620
that can trigger freezing,
can trigger the...

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.960
Some people talk about
the fawning response,

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.630
which has kind of an appeasing
response to traumatic events.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.750
But some people outright freeze
in response to fear, right?

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.600
We've heard of fight or flight.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.610
And indeed the pathway that I'm describing

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.050
can create a sense of fight

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.640
and cause people to want to lean in,

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.750
in an aggressive way to combat
things that they're afraid of

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.150
or flight to run away.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.170
Essentially to avoid
by mobilizing the thing

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.750
that they feel they're threatened by.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.880
Now, even in the absence of some threat,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.530
somebody that has say a
fear of public speaking

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.930
might hesitate or move away from a podium

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.160
or hesitate or move away
from raising their hand.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.300
If raising their hand meant
that they might be called on

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.890
and would be public speaking.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.000
So there's fight and flight,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.780
but there's also the freeze response.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.120
And the freeze response is controlled by

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.040
a number of brain centers,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.520
but the periaqueductal gray, the PAG,

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.760
is central for this freeze
response and neurons.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.900
They're also create what are
called Endogenous opioids.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.240
Many of you have heard
of the opioid crisis,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.520
which is a crisis of
prescription medication

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.450
given out too broadly for
people that don't need it,

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.020
who are become addicted to opioids.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.130
Those are Exogenous opioid.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.630
But Endogenous opioids

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.500
are chemicals released
from neurons in the PAG

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.920
and from elsewhere in the body

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.560
that give us a sense of numbing.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.040
They actually numb us against pain.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.770
And you can imagine why biology
would be organized this way.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.400
A threat occurs or something
that we perceive as a threat,

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.520
we're afraid of it.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.430
And a natural analgesic
is released into our body

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.370
because there's likely
to be an interaction

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.410
that's very uncomfortable.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.780
That's physically uncomfortable.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.460
So it's like we have our
own Endogenous release

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.340
of these opioids and that's
occurring in the PAG.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.660
The other area and again,

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.310
sorry to litter the conversation

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.020
with these names of structures,

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.210
but some people seem to enjoy
knowing these structures.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.960
You're fine if you just
understand what the structures do.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.350
If you want to know the names that's fine.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.570
But the other structure
is the locus coeruleus.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.510
The locus coeruleus
creates a sense of arousal,

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.630
by releasing Adrenaline,
Epinephrine and Norepinephrine,

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.400
or related chemical into the brain.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.390
So basically the activation
of the amygdaloid complex

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.160
could be from any number
of different things,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.700
a memory of something fearful.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.170
An actual sensory experience
of something that's fearful.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:02.170
And but then the fear
response itself is taking part

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.530
because of the threat
reflex gets activated.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:08.110
And that threat reflex
then sends a whole set

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.360
of other functions into action.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.430
Freezing, activation of the adrenals,

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.530
activation of locus coeruleus
for arousal and alertness,

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.020
activation of this endogenous pain system

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.860
or anti-pain system in the PAG.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.690
That's one pathway out of the amygdala.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.010
The other pathway out of the amygdala

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.090
is to a very interesting
area that typically

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.050
is associated with reward
and even addiction.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:33.570
So this might come as a
surprise to many of you.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.100
In fact, it came as a surprise to me.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.450
I remember when these data were published,

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.810
but the amygdala complex
actually projects to areas

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.580
of the Dopamine system.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.970
The so-called nucleus accumbens,

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.660
the mesolimbic reward pathway,

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.280
for those of you that want to look that up

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.543
or that remember from
the Dopamine episodes.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.490
We have pathways in our
brain that are associated

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.320
with pursuit, motivation and reward.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.810
And the neuromodulator
Dopamine is largely responsible

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.960
for that feeling of
craving, pursuit and reward.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.400
And this threat center is
actually able to communicate with

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.430
and activate the Dopamine system.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.150
And later you will realize
why that is very important

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.610
and why you can leverage
the Dopamine system

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.840
in order to wire in new memories
to replace fearful ones.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.730
So I've been hitting you with
a lot of names of things,

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:17.850
but for the moment,

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.350
even if you're interested in
all the Neuroscience names

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.310
and structures and so forth.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.740
I'd like you to just conceptualize

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.720
that you have a circuit in your brain,

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.500
meaning a set of cells and connections

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.160
that are arranged in the following way.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.910
You have a threat reflex that
can be activated at any time

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.400
very easily, but what
activates that threat reflex

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.900
can depend on two things.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:46.050
One are prior memories
coming from brain areas

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.450
that are involved in storage of memories,

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.520
or it can be immediate experiences.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.010
Things are happening in the now, okay?

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.210
So were something fearful
to happen right now,

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.330
your threat reflux could be activated.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.400
Where you to remember something very scary

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.410
that happened to you in the past?

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.100
Your threat reflex could be activated.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:07.100
And that threat reflex
circuit has two major outputs.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.370
One of the major outputs is
to areas that are involved in

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:15.040
the threat response, freezing
pain management and alertness.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.490
And the other major output
is to areas involved

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:22.393
in reward, motivation
and reinforcement, okay?

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.100
There's a fourth component.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.860
And I promise this is the last component

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.500
that we need to put into this picture

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.110
of the neural circuits for fear.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.080
And this is a circuit that
involves an area of the brain

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.980
called the prefrontal cortex
and some of its subdivision.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.563
So literally in the front.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.410
And it's involved in what
we call top-down processing.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:47.077
Top-down processing is the way
that your prefrontal cortex

00:28:47.077 --> 00:28:51.900
and other areas of the brain
can control or suppress

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.783
a reflex, okay?

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.680
A good example of this would
be the step on the tack example

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.513
that I gave before.

00:28:59.513 --> 00:29:00.580
So when you step on a tack,

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.250
you immediately pull up your foot

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.580
and you extend the other leg.

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.570
That's the reflex that prevents
you from injuring yourself

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:08.823
and from falling over.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:14.930
However, if you wanted,
not that you would want to.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.190
But if you wanted, you could for instance,

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.300
place your foot onto a tack

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.310
and decide not to pull your foot away.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.370
It would be difficult.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:25.200
And again, I don't
recommend that you do that,

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.370
but you could override that reflex, okay?

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.330
There are other examples of reflexes,

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:32.180
like for instance,
getting into cold water,

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.460
most people will start
to huddle their body.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.270
Most people won't want to
get into the cold water.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.200
Many people will jump out.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.253
But all of that is reflexive.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.250
And should you want to, you
could override that reflex

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:47.420
through top-down processing.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.347
You could tell yourself,

00:29:48.347 --> 00:29:50.420
"Oh, I heard on a previous
Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.090
or on an Instagram post
that cold water exposure

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.220
can be beneficial for metabolism
and resilience, et cetera."

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.270
And indeed it can, and you can
decide to get into the water

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.900
and to stretch out your
body, not to huddle,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.290
and you can fight those reflexes, okay?

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.150
The fighting of reflex
is carried out through

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:11.130
top-down processing, largely
through the prefrontal cortex.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.950
You provide a narrative.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.860
You tell yourself, "I want to
do this or I should do this.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:19.710
Or even though I don't want
to, I'm going to do it anyway."

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.600
So top-down processing

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.640
is not just for getting into cold water,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.530
and it certainly isn't
for overriding reflexes

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.040
that can damage us like a
stepping on the tack example.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.070
It is the way in which we can override

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.330
any number of internal reflexes,

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.170
including the threat reflex.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:43.170
And the way that we do that
is by giving a new story

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.990
or a new narrative to this
experience that we call threat.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.530
And you know the threat response,

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.500
the threat response is
quickening of the heart rate,

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.080
quickening of the breathing.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.850
We don't generally like the feeling

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.090
of Adrenaline in our system.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.970
Some people are so-called
Adrenaline junkies,

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.640
and they get a mixture of
Dopamine and Adrenaline

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.220
from certain high intensity events.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.390
I confess in previous aspects of my life,

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:07.950
I've tended to like Adrenaline.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.750
I don't think I was at the
extreme of thrill seeking,

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.980
but I'm somebody that for
instance, I tend to like...

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.060
I like roller coasters,
I've done various things

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.620
where I'm familiar with

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.700
and I enjoy the sensation
of Adrenaline in my body.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.243
But I enjoy it because of
the alertness that it brings

00:31:25.243 --> 00:31:27.370
and the hyperacuity that it brings,

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:28.960
many people don't feel that way.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.560
In fact, most people
don't like the sensation

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.790
of a lot of Adrenaline in their system.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.390
That it makes them feel very uncomfortable

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:37.060
and out of control.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.290
We will do an entire
episode about Adrenaline

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:42.010
and Adrenaline junkies
and Adrenaline aversives

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.000
in the future.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.290
But the threat reflex inevitably involves

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.750
the release of Adrenaline into the system.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.780
And then it becomes a
question of whether or not

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:55.090
you remain still, move forward or retreat

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.490
from that Adrenaline experience.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.800
And when I say the Adrenaline experience,

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.170
I mean the threat reflex.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:04.360
So this fourth component of
fear is really our ability

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.600
to attach narrative, to attach a meaning

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.380
and to attach purpose to
what is by all accounts

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.760
and purposes, a generic response.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.750
There's no negotiating
what fear feels like.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.230
There's only negotiating what it means.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.670
There's only negotiating
whether or not you persist,

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.220
whether or not you pause or
whether or not you retreat.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.250
So this is usually the
point in the podcast

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:27.317
where I think people start asking,

00:32:27.317 --> 00:32:28.610
"Okay, well, there's the biology,

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.620
there's the mechanism, there's the logic.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.230
How do I eliminate fear?"

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.750
Well, it's not quite that simple.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.380
Although by understanding
the logic and the mechanisms

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.290
by which these circuits are built,

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.090
we can eventually get to that place.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.530
I do want to plant a flag
around a particular type of tool

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.390
or a logical framework around a particular

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:50.900
set of tools rather,

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.030
that we are going to build
out through this episode.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:58.900
And based on what you now
know that the threat reflex

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.690
gets input and it has outputs

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.700
and it's subject to these
top-down processing events,

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.853
these narratives.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.160
You should be asking yourself,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.000
what sort of narratives should
I apply to eliminate fear?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.740
Well, first let's take a step back

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.710
and just acknowledged the reality,

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:23.710
which is that fear is in some
cases, an adaptive response.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:26.850
We don't want people eliminating fears

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.300
that can get them
injured or killed, right?

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.400
The reason that the fear threat response

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.570
and reflex exists at all
is to help us from dying,

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.050
to help us from making
really bad decisions.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.830
It just so happens that a
number of things happened to us

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:45.000
that are not lethal, that don't harm us,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.170
but that harm us from the inside.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.890
And I think that and here
I'm borrowing language

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:52.900
from an excellent researcher

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.090
who's done important work
in this area at Harvard.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.100
His name is Dr. Kerry Ressler.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.810
He's both a medical doctor
and a PhD, so an MD-PhD.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.150
He's the chief scientific
officer at McLean Hospital.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.450
He's a professor of psychiatry
at Harvard Medical School,

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.440
and he's done extensive
and important work on fear.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.980
I'm going to refer back
to Dr. Ressler's work

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.550
several times during this podcast,

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:15.800
including important and
super interesting work

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.680
on transgenerational passage of trauma.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.620
He's a absolutely world-class biologist,

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.040
absolutely world-class clinician.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:29.040
And Dr. Ressler has described
fear before as containing

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.800
a historical component.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.120
So it's not just about a
readiness for things that might

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.380
injure us or kill us in
the immediate circumstance

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.110
but also protecting us for the future

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.220
because of our important need
and ability to anticipate.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:49.210
And what he describes our
memories as protective

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.270
or memories as dangerous.

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:52.560
You know, some memories,

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.170
even if they evoke a sense
of fear in us are protective.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.160
They protect us from making bad mistakes

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.990
that could get us injured or killed,

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.710
or put us into really
horrible circumstances.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.650
Other memories are dangerous

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.860
because they create a
sense in us of discomfort,

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.010
and they tend to limit our behavior

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.910
in ways that are maladaptive.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.710
That prevent us from having
healthy relationships to others,

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.760
healthy job relationships,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.330
healthy relationship
to ourselves, frankly.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.570
So this language of memories as protective

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.210
or memories as dangerous
in the context of fear

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:26.400
is not something that I said,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.140
it's really something that
I lifted from Dr. Ressler

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.630
in one of his many impressive lectures.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:35.820
And it's an important aspect of fear

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:40.310
because much of the fear
system is a memory system.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:42.870
Is designed to embed a memory

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:46.210
of certain previous experiences in us.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.720
Such that the threat reflex is activated

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.850
in anticipation of what
might happen, okay?

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.550
So let's talk for a second
about how certain memories

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.160
get attached to this fear system.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.520
And this brings us to a beautiful

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.830
and indeed Nobel Prize winning aspect

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:04.730
of biology and physiology,
which is Pavlovian conditioning.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:07.230
Many of you are probably
familiar with Pavlov's dogs

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:10.490
and the famous Pavlovian
conditioning experiments.

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:11.890
They go something like this.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.280
And Pavlov did these
experiments and ring a bell,

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.380
a dog doesn't do much
in response to a bell.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.213
It might attend to it

00:36:20.213 --> 00:36:22.720
but it doesn't salivate typically
in response to the bell.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.530
However, if you pair the ringing of a bell

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.380
with a presentation of food enough times,

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.610
the dog will salivate
in response to the food.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.080
Eventually you take away the food,

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.160
you just rang the bell
and the dog will salivate

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.950
in response to the bell, okay?

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.630
So in the context of so-called
Pavlovian conditioning,

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.660
these things have names
like conditioned stimulus,

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.150
and unconditional stimulus and responses.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.277
People often get these mixed up

00:36:43.277 --> 00:36:45.080
and it can be a little confusing,

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.180
but I'm just going to make
it really simple for you.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.280
The unconditioned stimulus
is the thing that evokes

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.850
a response unconditionally.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.920
So food is the unconditioned stimulus

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.410
in the example I just gave.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:00.010
A foot shock or a loud bang

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.560
would be the unconditioned
stimulus in a...

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.393
For instance say,

00:37:03.393 --> 00:37:06.500
an experiment geared
toward exploring fear.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.740
That unconditioned
stimulus is unconditional.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.150
It unconditionally evokes a startle

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.333
or in the case of food salivating.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:18.660
The bell in the previous
example is what we call

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.000
the conditioned stimulus or
the conditioning stimulus.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.370
Sometimes people mix these up.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:28.880
The condition stimulus is
paired with the thing that

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.437
naturally creates a response.

00:37:30.437 --> 00:37:32.670
And then eventually the condition stimulus

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.560
creates the response itself.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.630
You might think, well,
that just seems endlessly

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:40.290
boring and simple, but
this is actually the way

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.380
that our fear systems work.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.370
Except unlike Pavlov's
dogs, you don't need many,

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:51.370
many pairings of a bell with
some unconditioned stimulus

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.250
in order to get a response.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.070
You can get what's called
one trial learning.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.530
And in this circuit that
involves the amygdala,

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:58.363
the threat reflex,

00:37:58.363 --> 00:38:02.463
and all this other stuff that
I was talking about earlier,

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.550
the system is set up for learning.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.740
It's set up to create memories
and to anticipate problems.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.930
It's a very good system

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.020
because it was designed to keep us safe.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.940
And so the way to think about
this is that for many people,

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:22.470
one intense experience,
one burn, one bad breakup,

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.670
one bad experience, public speaking.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.700
One bad experience with somebody pet snake

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:32.180
or whatever it happens to
be can cause intense fear

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.040
in the moment, a long
[indistinct] experience of fear,

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.310
like trouble sleeping that
night and the following night.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:40.370
Memories of the experience
that are troubling,

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.520
physiological responses
that are troubling.

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:48.150
Essentially it gets wired
in as a fear with one trial.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.820
Which is quite different
than the other forms

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.830
of neuroplasticity.

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:51.760
Neuroplasticity, of course,

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.880
just being the nervous
system's ability to change

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.050
in response to experience.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:56.220
Other forms of neuroplasticity

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.470
like learning a language, learning music,

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.700
learning math, those take a while.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.310
We don't generally get one trial learning

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.140
to positive or neutral experiences.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.110
We get one trial learning
to negative experiences.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.210
So there's this asymmetry
in how we're wired.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:14.670
So now you should understand
how classical conditioning

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.840
as it's called occurs.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.480
You go to give a piano recital as a kid,

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.530
you sit down and you freeze up

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.440
and it's horribly embarrassing.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.470
And even if you just freeze
up for a few seconds,

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:30.030
the heart rate increase
and the perspiring,

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:33.130
the sweating and the shame that you feel

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:36.270
leads you to want to
avoid playing instruments

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:39.970
or public displays of performances

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.760
for a long period of time

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.540
unless you do something to overcome it.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.020
That's one trial learning.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.230
Some people,

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:50.160
it tends to be more an
accumulation of experiences.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.780
They have a bad relationship
that lasts an entire summer,

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.750
an entire year, or God forbid a decade.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:57.990
And then they have what they feel

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.050
is of a general sense of fear
about closeness to others,

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:01.883
an attachment.

00:40:01.883 --> 00:40:04.300
These are common fears
that people experience.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.520
Fears can be in the short-term,

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.560
fears can be in the long-term,

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.770
they can be in the medium term.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.810
Again, the fear system is very generic.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:15.450
It's wired to include
memories that are very acute,

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.980
that happened within a
moment, or that include many,

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.450
many events in long periods of time.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.810
That kind of funnel into a general sense

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:27.350
of relationships are bad
or this particular city

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:28.760
or location is bad.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.380
So there's a key what we
call temporal component.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.780
There's a component of the fear system

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.250
being able to batch many events in time

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.830
and create one specific fear

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.860
or take one very specific
isolated incident

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.870
that happened very briefly
and create one very large

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.090
general sense of fears.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.620
And I'll give an example of the latter,

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.610
just to kind of flesh
this out a little bit.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.920
I had a friend come
visit me in San Francisco

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.540
some years ago, and their
car got broken into.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.810
Unfortunately, a frequent
occurrence in San Francisco

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:02.643
even in the middle of the day.

00:41:02.643 --> 00:41:04.070
Never leave anything
your car in San Francisco

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.780
they'll break in, in the middle
of the day, doesn't matter.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.220
Police can be having coffee right there

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.210
in front of them they'll still do it,

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:13.720
for reasons we could
discuss, this is a problem.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.070
They got their belongings
taken and they decided

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.530
they were never coming
back to San Francisco.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:22.880
This was an isolated
incident that forever colored

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.890
their view of the city.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.640
Which I frankly,
understanding the fear system,

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.210
I can understand.

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:31.580
We can have isolated
incidents that wick out

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.770
to broad decisions about entire places,

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:38.220
or we can have many experiences
that funnel into very

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.410
specific isolated fears about
particular circumstances,

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:42.720
places and things.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.060
So I like to think that by
now you have a pretty good

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.620
understanding of the
circuits that underlie

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.540
the threat reflex, the fear response,

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.020
and how we have top-down control,

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:57.120
meaning we can attach a
narrative to the fear response.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.720
And that the fear response can be learned

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.223
in association with
particular events, okay?

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:07.110
I haven't really talked about
how the learning occurs.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.210
And so I just want to take
a moment and describe that

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.230
because it leads right into our discussion

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.500
about how to eliminate fears,

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.110
and indeed how to replace fears

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.290
with more positive experiences.

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:18.880
There's a process in our nervous system

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.390
that we call neuroplasticity.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:22.040
Neuroplasticity broadly defined

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.450
is the nervous system's ability to change

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.150
in response to experience.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.410
But at a cellular level,

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:31.230
that occurs through a couple
of different mechanisms.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.990
One of the main mechanisms
is something called

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.560
long-term potentiation.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.710
Long-term potentiation
involves the strengthening

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.850
of particular connections between neurons.

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.400
The connection sites between
neurons we call synapses,

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.320
actually technically synapses are the gaps

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.030
between those connections.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.870
But nonetheless, synapses are
the point of communication

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:52.330
between neurons and
those can be strengthened

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:54.310
so that certain neurons
can talk to other neurons

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:57.760
more robustly than they
happened to before.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.000
And anytime we talk
about a particular event,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.320
the car, the snake, the
public speaking, the trauma,

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:09.320
the horrible experience,
wiring into the fear system.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:12.350
What we're talking about is a
change in synaptic strengths.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.700
We're talking about
neurons that previously

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.960
did not communicate well,
communicating very well.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.760
It's like going from a old
school dial up connection,

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.530
or even an old school telephone connection

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.220
or Morse code connection of communication

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.933
to high speed ethernet, okay?

00:43:27.933 --> 00:43:30.010
To a 5G connection.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:32.190
It gets faster, it gets more robust,

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:33.990
and it's very, very clear.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:37.120
That's what happens when you
get long-term potentiation.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.740
And long-term potentiation involves

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.100
a couple of cellular mechanisms

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.160
that are going to be
relevant to our discussion

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.210
about treatments to undue fear.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.650
And I'll just throw out
a couple of the names

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:49.330
of some of those cellular
elements right now.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.490
The main one is the
so-called N-M-D-A receptor,

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:54.540
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.970
And what this is, is this
is a little docking site,

00:43:56.970 --> 00:44:00.210
like a little parking slot on a neuron.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:04.160
And when a neuron gets
activated very strongly

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.100
like from an intense event
in the example of my friend,

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.560
the intense event.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.890
Almost certainly activated
and NMDA receptors

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:13.440
related to their concept of
protecting their property

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.120
in their cars, the break into their car

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.340
caused the NMDA receptor to be activated.

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.350
Normally that NMDA receptor
is not easily activated

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.930
when it is activated
it sets off a cascade,

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:28.830
a series of signals within those neurons

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:30.060
that change those neurons.

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.800
It changes the genes they express,

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.810
it shuttles more parking spots
to the surface of those cells

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:39.290
so that the communication to
those cells becomes easier,

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:40.600
it becomes faster.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.600
And so the way to think
about the NMDA receptor

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.370
is it's used sometimes for normal things

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:47.960
that we do every day,
making cups of coffee

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:48.793
and things like that.

00:44:48.793 --> 00:44:50.760
But it's often used for learning.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.620
It's used for creating a new associations

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.040
in our nervous system.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.760
And so the activation of
the NMDA receptor and LTP,

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.210
and it involves some other things

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:02.210
that you may have heard of like,

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:05.290
brain-derived neurotrophic
factor and calcium entry,

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.960
things that we can leave for a
discussion for a future time.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.020
But basically a whole cascade
of events happen within cells

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.760
that then make just even the
mere thought of something

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:19.260
or somebody or some event that happened

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:22.530
able to activate that threat reflex, okay?

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.520
So long-term potentiation is
one of the main mechanisms

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.800
by which we take formerly
innocuous or irrelevant events,

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.940
and we make them scary.

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:33.700
We make them traumatic.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.050
Our neurons have mechanisms to do this.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.460
Now, fortunately, the NMDA receptor

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.710
and long-term potentiation

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:43.180
can also run the whole system in reverse.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.650
You can get what's called
a long-term depression,

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:48.860
and that doesn't have anything
to do with the depression

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:50.650
associated with low mood.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:52.930
What we're talking about is
a weakening of connections.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:55.920
You can go from having a very
high speed ethernet connection

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.820
between neurons, so to speak,

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.750
to a connection that's
more like Morse code,

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:04.260
or as like a poor dial up
connection or really weak signal.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.280
And that's what's happening
when you extinguish a fear,

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.190
when you unlearn a fear.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.750
So now I'd like to talk about
therapies that are carried out

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:17.420
in humans that allow fears to be undone,

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.830
that allow traumas to be reversed,

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.970
such that people no longer feel bad about

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.780
a particular person, place or thing.

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:28.710
Either real interactions with
that person, place or thing,

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:32.700
or imagine interactions with
that person, place or thing.

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.390
That process as I just mentioned

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.020
also involves things
like the NMDA receptor

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:41.610
but rather than
strengthening the connections

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:43.520
the first thing that has
to happen is there needs

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.320
to be a weakening of
connections that associate

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.890
the person, place or thing
with that threat reflex.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:50.940
Subsequent to that,

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.180
we will see there needs
to be a strengthening

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.620
of some new experience
that's positive, okay?

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:58.910
This is a key element
of where we are headed

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:00.683
contrary to popular belief,

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.320
it is not going to work to
simply extinguish a fear.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.690
One needs to extinguish
a fear and or trauma

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:14.680
and replace that fearful
or traumatic memory

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.540
or idea or response with
a positive response.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.280
And this is something
that's rarely discussed

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.800
both in the scientific literature,

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.240
but certainly in the general discussion

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.580
around fear and trauma.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.640
There's this idea that
we can extinguish fears,

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.110
we can rewire ourselves, we
can eliminate our traumas

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:33.470
and indeed we can.

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:37.720
But that process has to
involve not just becoming

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.220
comfortable with a particular
fearful event or trauma,

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:44.120
but also attaching a
new positive experience

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.700
to that previously fearful
or traumatic event.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.310
There are a lot of different
approaches out there

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:53.890
that are in clinical
use to try and alleviate

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:56.480
fear and trauma and indeed PTSD,

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.030
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:02.230
It might be surprising to learn

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:05.850
that many of those
treatments such as SSRIs,

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:08.640
the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.580
Things like Prozac and Zoloft and similar

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.390
and other antidepressants.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.150
Or things like Benzodiazepines,

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:18.650
which are essentially like painkillers.

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:22.600
They create elevation in certain
transmitters in the brain

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.310
like GABA among others.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.580
They can have a pain relieving effect.

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.240
They are generally however,
considered anxiolytics,

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:35.240
they reduce anxiety and
even antipsychotic drugs

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:38.930
or Beta blockers sometimes
called adrenergic blockers.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.820
Drugs that are designed
to prevent the heart

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.450
from beating too fast or
to reduce blood pressure,

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:45.580
to reduce some elements

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.980
of the hypothalamic-pituitary
axis response

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.570
that we talked about earlier.

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.990
Many people experienced
some degree of relief

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.630
from the symptoms of
anxiety and fear and PTSD

00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:59.460
in taking these various compounds.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.160
Indeed, that's why they're
prescribed so broadly.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.750
But you may find it interesting to note

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:08.120
that none of those current treatments

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.590
are based on the neurobiology of fear,

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.510
at least not directly, right?

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:15.710
People that take SSRIs
oftentimes will experience

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:18.030
a reduction in anxiety.

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:19.080
It depends on the dosage

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.510
and the individual of course, right?

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:22.450
And you have to work with
a doctor, a psychiatrist,

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.230
to determine whether or
not they're right for you

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.820
in the correct dosage, if
they are right for you.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:31.820
But that modulation of
anxiety can indirectly

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:35.120
reduce the likelihood that
one will have a panic attack

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.900
or experience of fear, an
intense experience of fear

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.500
or reliving of a trauma.

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:43.230
But the SSRIs themselves are not plugging

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:46.600
into some specific mechanism
related to how fear

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.900
comes about in the system.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.643
It's an indirect support.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:55.760
That's important because if
the goal of modern psychiatry

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.660
and the goal of modern
biology is to provide

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:02.210
mechanistic understanding
that leads to treatments.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:04.600
We need to think about what
are the sorts of treatments

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.810
that tap into the very fear circuits

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:07.920
that we described before.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.530
The fact that there are memories attached

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:12.890
to a generic threat reflex and response.

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:16.100
And the threat reflex and
response can be linked up

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.040
with the Dopamine system

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.480
and can be linked up with other systems

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.400
that are involved in pain,
relief and anxiety and so forth.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.650
And so that brings us to which treatments

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:27.900
are directly related to the fear circuitry

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.060
and the circuitry related to trauma?

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:34.400
And the primary one to
begin with is the so-called

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.870
behavioral therapies.

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:40.350
Now, oftentimes we all wish
I think from time to time

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.420
that there's some specific
pill that we can take

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.550
or there's some machine or device

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:44.780
that we can plug our finger into

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.880
or that we can put on a headset

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.040
and all of a sudden we just
rewire our nervous system.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.580
Fear has gone, trauma's gone,
but it doesn't work that way.

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:56.580
And when we think of language
and narrative as a tool

00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:59.630
to rewire our nervous system

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.300
in comparison to those
kinds of ideas about pills

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.300
and machines and potions,

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.280
it starts to seem a
little bit weak, right?

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.060
If we just think, "Oh,
well, how could talking

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:12.630
actually change the way that
we respond to something?"

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.690
But actually there are
three forms of therapy

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.190
that purely through the use of language

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:21.500
have been shown to have
very strong positive impact,

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.230
meaning reduce fears and traumas.

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:27.720
And those three are
prolonged exposure therapy,

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.840
cognitive processing, or CPT

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.650
and cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:34.360
And I not going to go
into the entire literature

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.750
around prolonged exposure,
cognitive processing,

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:38.550
and cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:41.360
But I will just illustrate
the central theme

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.220
that allows them to work.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:46.810
Now, remember that the circuit for fear,

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:50.030
the circuit for trauma
involves this generic reflex.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:51.730
And then there are those top-down elements

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:53.430
coming from the forebrain.

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.920
It's very clear because it's been measured

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.960
that if you look at the amount of anxiety,

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.660
the pure physiological anxiety response

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.910
of quickening of heart
rate, flushing of the skin,

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:10.840
sometimes quaking of the hands,

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.180
that the experience of fear over time

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.810
when people recount or retell their trauma

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:20.170
that the first time they do that

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:23.500
especially when it's
recounted in a lot of detail

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.750
there's a tremendous anxiety response.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:30.730
Sometimes even as great or
greater than the actual exposure

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:32.950
to the fearful event or trauma.

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:35.610
And obviously this is
something that is done

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:37.480
with a clinician present,

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.940
because it is very
traumatic to the person.

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:43.240
They're literally reliving the
trauma in full rich detail,

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.750
and they are encouraged to
provide full rich detail.

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:50.070
They're often encouraged to
speak in complete sentences

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:54.090
to flush out details about
how they felt in inside,

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.490
to flush out details about their memories

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:59.760
going into this traumatic
or fearful event,

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.060
going through it.

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:05.160
And after really digging
into all the nuance

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.723
and contours of these
horrible experiences.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.790
But what's remarkable is that
in the second and the third

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:17.110
and the fourth retelling
of these traumatic

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.167
or fearful events that anxiety response

00:53:20.167 --> 00:53:22.890
and the amount of the
physiological response,

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:26.120
I should say that the
amplitude of the physiological

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.590
becomes progressively
diminished with each retelling.

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:31.617
Now, some of you might be saying,

00:53:31.617 --> 00:53:34.993
"Well, duh, you know, you
tell a story enough times,

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.940
that eventually it wears off."

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.127
Just like if you watch
a movie enough times

00:53:39.127 --> 00:53:41.340
and you hear the same joke enough times

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.650
eventually it doesn't
have the same impact.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:46.420
But that [indistinct] be the case, right?

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:50.680
You could imagine that this
high amplitude anxiety response,

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.150
this high amplitude activation

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:54.860
of the sympathetic nervous
system in retelling

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:59.860
would actually create a even
deeper routed fear response

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.510
and trauma but that's not what happens.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:05.730
And every clinician I
spoke to in anticipation

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.730
of this episode which include
clinical psychologists,

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:09.810
psychiatrists and people who actually

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:12.720
work on the fear system
at a biological level

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.847
said the exact same thing which is that,

00:54:14.847 --> 00:54:18.730
"A detailed recounting of the traumatic

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:21.830
and fearful events is absolutely essential

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:25.660
in order to get the positive
effects of prolonged exposure,

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.140
cognitive processing and
cognitive behavioral therapy."

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.600
Again, this has to be done
with the appropriate support.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.970
This isn't something that
should be taken lightly

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.930
because as we've mentioned before

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:38.030
the fear response can
have a very long lasting

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.960
contour to it.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.150
People can sometimes have trouble sleeping

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:42.000
for days and days.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.150
And afterwards we'll talk
about sleep in a little bit.

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:48.680
But the point is that the
retelling is important.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:52.820
And the idea here is to
take what was a terrible

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.833
and extremely troubling,

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.760
meaning physiologically troubling,

00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.870
psychologically troubling story,

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:04.670
and turn it into what
is essentially a boring,

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:06.600
bad story, okay?

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.720
It never really becomes a
good story at this point

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:12.380
in the treatment process
that we're describing.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:16.000
So a terrible event is
a terrible event period.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.310
But there's a way in which
the retelling of that event

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:24.310
starts to uncouple the threat
reflex from the narrative.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:28.340
And with each successive
retelling in detail

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:31.570
of these traumatic events,
of these fearful events,

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:36.570
the threat reflex is
activated at a progressively

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.010
lower and lower amplitude.

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:41.930
Such that eventually it
just becomes a really bad,

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:43.483
really boring story.

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:48.100
Now that's one part of the
process of getting over a fear.

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.590
It's what we call fear extinction.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:53.420
And we can bring ourselves
back to our earlier example

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.250
of Pavlovian conditioning,

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:56.950
because many studies have been done

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:59.480
both in animals and in
humans showing that,

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:03.720
for instance, if you pair
a tone, a bell or a buzzer

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.070
with a foot shock that
an animal or a person

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:09.120
will brace themselves for the foot shock.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:12.600
Eventually you can just
give the bell or a tone

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.980
and the person will experience
that same freezing up

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.700
or the same fight or
flight or freeze response.

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.680
So you conditioned that.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:23.490
But if you give the tone
or the bell over and over,

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:25.920
and there's no foot
shock, there's no pain,

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.810
and in human [indistinct]
sometimes I'm with foot shocks,

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:29.920
sometimes believe it
or not with mild burn,

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.470
even some studies, there is older studies

00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:33.710
you couldn't do those now,
nor would you want to.

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:36.920
But eventually what happens is the tone...

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:41.050
The bell no longer evokes
that response, okay?

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:45.580
So you see this as a reversal
of the classical conditioning

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:47.790
and we call that reversal extinction.

00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:49.530
So the retelling of this traumatic

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:51.980
or fearful narrative, excuse me,

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:56.980
fearful narrative is essentially
an extinction process.

00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:59.850
Now, how is this done?

00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:02.900
One can do this in a
therapist office face-to-face,

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:03.910
that's sometimes done.

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:05.850
It's sometimes done in group type settings

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:07.310
where people actually stand up

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:09.680
or sit in front of a group small or large

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.760
and recount in detail
their traumatic experience.

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.830
It's sometimes done by people writing out

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:18.800
the experience in detail.

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.760
And which one of these
is the most effective?

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.080
Isn't really clear.

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.970
The literature points to the
fact that a feeling of trust

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:29.070
obviously between the
patient and the clinician

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:31.790
or the person and the group is essential.

00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:34.130
Some people don't have
access to because of finances

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:36.680
or other limitations to
therapy of that sort.

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.450
In that case, journaling in detail

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.580
has been shown to be effective.

00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:43.560
Although, again, I want to caution people

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:46.590
about reactivating traumas
without consideration

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:49.060
for the kinds of social
support they might need

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.700
around that reactivation.

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.330
And we will talk a little bit later about

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:54.290
some of the chemicals
involved in social support

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:56.730
and why those help extinguish fears.

00:57:56.730 --> 00:58:00.620
So the thing to embed in
your mind is that recognition

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:04.650
of the early traumatic or
fearful event in detail

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:07.130
over and over is key to forming

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:12.130
a new non-traumatic association
with that event or person.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:18.930
So that's part one, you need
to diminish the old experience.

00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:19.960
And when I say diminish,

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:24.320
I mean, reduce the amplitude
of the physiological response.

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.210
Now this is just but one approach.

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:27.600
I'm going to talk about other approaches

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.280
to eliminating fear and
trauma as we go forward.

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.870
But I want to emphasize that
diminishing the amplitude

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:36.480
of the physiological
response is the first step.

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.400
So it's like a clearing
away of the association

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.900
between the person, place or
thing and that threat reflex.

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.670
But even after that's occurred,

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:50.800
there's an essential need
to relearn a new narrative.

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.730
Why is their essential need
to relearn a new narrative

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:56.360
or create a new association?

00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:59.340
Well, that has to do with
that fear reflect circuitry.

00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:02.980
As you recall, there outputs
two areas of the brain

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:06.250
that are associated with Dopamine
release and reinforcement.

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:09.000
And that we now know offers the capacity

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.150
for these fear circuits

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:12.220
in these circuits that underlie trauma

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.930
to be mapped onto new experiences

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:18.500
that are of positive association.

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.400
So I'm going to give a
kind of basic example.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.360
It's a kind of a silly example,

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:26.320
but I'm giving it as a
template for what could be

00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.590
any number of other different examples.

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:32.050
Example I'll give is
let's say a kid is biking

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:35.180
to play soccer, soccer practice,

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:38.690
and they get into a
bad car accident, okay?

00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:40.960
Terrible thing to
happen, but they survive.

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.230
They recover.

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:43.970
And somehow...

00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:47.210
And we really don't know
why certain fear memories

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:50.330
get wired in more
broadly or more narrowly.

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:54.120
Somehow this kid just doesn't
even want to bicycle anymore.

00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.650
And they actually don't
even want to play sports.

00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:57.430
And they actually just
don't want to go anywhere.

00:59:57.430 --> 01:00:00.003
They're kind of isolating and
not interacting with friends

01:00:00.003 --> 01:00:01.050
very much at all.

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:02.310
It's a pretty broad response.

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:03.690
It didn't have to be that way.

01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:06.870
Some kids would just decide they
don't want to cycle any more

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.560
down that particular street.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:12.170
Well, the process of
retelling the narrative

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:15.500
to a clinician would allow an extinction

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.990
of the fear response, right?

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:19.430
So a reduction in the heart rate,

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:20.940
a reduction in the narrowing of focus,

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:23.720
a reduction in all the
things that we consider fear.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.600
But a really good cognitive
behavioral therapist

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.790
or somebody that understands
the Neuroscience of fear

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:34.290
and trauma would understand
that that's not sufficient.

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:37.210
That's what it's really
important is that this child,

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:40.020
this hypothetical child
relearn a new narrative

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:43.260
that they don't just manage
to bike to soccer practice

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.210
or manage to spend time with friends,

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:47.440
but that they actually start

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:51.260
wiring in new positive associations

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.810
with biking to practice,
with playing soccer,

01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:55.330
with social events.

01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:58.280
And, and this is the somewhat
surprising feature of this

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.330
and that they link that back

01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:02.690
to that early traumatic experience.

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:05.470
That it's not just that they're replacing

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:07.300
that bad experience and memory

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.210
with a good experience and memory,

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:11.790
but they're actually holding in mind

01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:14.840
in these top-down narrative
circuits, if you will.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.127
They're holding in mind,

01:01:16.127 --> 01:01:19.460
"Ah, I'm not just biking
to soccer practice.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.890
I'm actually biking to soccer
practice and I'm enjoying it

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:25.970
despite the fact that I
was in a bad car accident.

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:28.610
Despite the fact that two
months ago or two years ago,

01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:30.350
or maybe even 10 years ago,

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:31.920
I couldn't even leave my room

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.030
or I didn't want to
associate with anybody."

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.450
So the building up of the
positive associations are key.

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:40.660
And the linking of those
positive associations with the

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:45.610
earlier traumatic event is
key for the following reason,

01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:48.720
the top-down circuitry
from the prefrontal cortex

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.880
to this threat reflex circuit

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:55.250
is not like the other
connections in that circuit.

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:56.870
The other connections in that circuit

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:59.990
are what we call
glutamatergic and excitatory.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:02.830
They are all about
activating other neurons,

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:03.850
like a chain reaction.

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:05.540
One neuron activates, the next activates,

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.090
the next like dominoes falling.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:13.760
These top-down circuits that
feed into the threat reflex

01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:18.210
and all its parts is
what we call inhibitory.

01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:23.210
It tends to prevent activation
of those given circuitries.

01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:26.360
It tends to prevent activation
of the threat reflex.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.180
So it's acting as a break.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.790
And so when we think
of positive experiences

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:33.470
being associated with what was previously

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:36.450
a negative experience,
we're not talking about

01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:38.520
forgetting that the car
accident was horrible

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.090
or forgetting that the assault
was absolutely dreadful.

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:46.540
We're talking about attaching
a new positive memory

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:51.540
to the circuitry so that
the previous fear response

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.540
is far less likely to occur

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.840
and that it remains extinguished.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.790
So just to make sure
this is absolutely clear,

01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:00.760
there's a first step which
involves retelling and reliving

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.100
in order to extinguish
the fear and the trauma,

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:05.340
to reduce the amplitude of the response.

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.770
Then there's a need to replace or attach

01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:12.070
positive experiences to the earlier

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:13.750
what would be traumatic response.

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:16.850
The extinction has to
go first, this is key.

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:18.550
You can't simply say, "Oh, you know,

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:20.450
the car accident was actually a good thing

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:23.340
because I stayed home a lot
that year and I got to study."

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:26.450
You can tell yourself that
and that could also be true.

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:29.570
But that won't necessarily
and probably won't

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:33.380
eliminate the fear or
the traumatic association

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:34.670
of the car accident.

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:38.120
And again, I'm using car
accidents as a general example

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.140
or a generic example here, okay?

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.500
So there's a three-part process.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.870
One diminished the old experience through

01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:45.580
repetitive narrative.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.730
And almost inevitably
the initial repetition

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:51.510
of that is going to be very high amplitude

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:52.890
and quite troubling.

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:54.470
But over time it will reduce, right?

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:57.610
You're turning that terrible
really upsetting story

01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:59.943
into a terrible boring story.

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:02.320
That's the extinction process.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.470
Then there's a relearning
of a new narrative

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:06.440
that includes some sort
of sense of reward.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.120
And that sense of reward
has to be tacked back

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.880
on to the traumatic event

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.830
or what was previously a traumatic event.

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:15.990
And that is all through narrative.

01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:17.720
It's all through cognition.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.760
And I think this is a
very important point.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.980
Oftentimes I think we tend to undervalue

01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:25.850
the importance of rationalization

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:28.000
and of story and of narrative.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.500
But the prefrontal cortex
is this amazing capacity

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.910
of our brain real estate
to create meaning,

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:38.060
to attach meaning and purpose
to things that otherwise

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.610
are just reflexive.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.250
And in the example of an ice bath,

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:42.880
it might be a little trivial.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.620
In the example of the
kid with a car accident,

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.650
it becomes a little more relevant.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:50.010
And in the example of things
like people surviving,

01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:55.010
you know, genocide or attaching
stories of great victory

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.700
to what were previously thought
of as stories of great loss

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.780
of time, of people, of
any number of things.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.460
That process of narrative
is one of the major ways

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.730
that the human brain rewires itself.

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:13.700
Narrative should not be
undervalued as a tool

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.210
for relieving fear and trauma.

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:19.310
In fact, narrative is one of the best

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:22.830
and most potent ways that we
can rewire our fear circuitry.

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:25.730
And that indeed we can form
completely new relationships

01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:27.230
to things over time.

01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:30.620
So basically narratives
should not be undervalued

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:33.500
as a tool to rewire our nervous system

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.060
but it has to be engaged
in the correct sequence.

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:38.850
And that correct sequence
is first extinction,

01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:42.750
then relearning a new narrative
with positive associations

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:44.870
and attaching those positive associations

01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:48.070
to the formerly traumatic
or fearful event.

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:50.150
Now I mentioned prolonged
exposure therapy,

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:53.060
cognitive processing, and
cognitive behavioral therapy.

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:56.370
For those of you that are
seeking relief from fear

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:57.700
and traumatic events,

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:02.090
you can look up licensed
clinicians that can carry out

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:04.920
those one or several of
those types of therapies.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.780
I get a lot of questions
about other forms of therapy.

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:10.900
One of the ones that comes
up a lot is so-called

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.490
EMDR, Eye Movement
Desensitization and Reprocessing

01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:17.880
developed by Francine Shapiro in the 80s.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.740
Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing involves

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:24.660
moving the eyes side to side
while recounting a traumatic

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:28.493
or fearful narrative typically
with a clinician present.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.730
Why would that work?

01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:35.550
Well, basically when I
first heard about EMDR

01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:37.260
from my stance as a vision scientist

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.060
I thought the whole
thing was kind of crazy

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.650
and half-baked frankly.

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:41.727
I heard these theories that,

01:06:41.727 --> 01:06:44.610
"Oh, it recreates the eye movements

01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:47.277
in rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep."

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:49.420
And that's completely false.

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.610
It does not.

01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:55.610
I heard the argument EMDR
activates both sides of the brain,

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.340
which I guess hypothetically

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.183
was thought to be important somehow.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.900
And frankly, there's
no evidence whatsoever

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.000
that EMDR activates
both sides of the brain

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.480
in a way that's beneficial.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.160
I mean, by looking from side to side,

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.340
just because of the way that
binocular vision circuits

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.670
are organized it will do that.

01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:15.420
But it never made any sense
to me why EMDR would work

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.980
until several years ago when I saw.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:22.360
Because I reviewed no
fewer than five papers.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.440
Some in animal models, others in humans

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.050
looking at lateral eye movements.

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:30.160
Meaning I moving from side
to side with eyes open,

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.590
not eyes up or down.

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:34.610
And what was observed in these experiments

01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:35.830
in all of them actually,

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:39.870
all five of those papers
was a dramatic reduction

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:43.480
in the activation and
actually an inhibition

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.120
a suppression of the fear
or threat reflect circuitry

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.180
which was a jaw dropper for me.

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:53.030
I thought, "Wow, it
actually was a jaw dropper."

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:54.380
I widened that.

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.440
For me, I thought, "Oh my goodness,

01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:00.390
maybe this EMDR stuff works
according to some mechanism.

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:01.560
And maybe this is the mechanism."

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.620
And indeed many laboratories, not mine,

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.750
but many laboratories are
now pursuing that idea.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:07.510
And it's looking very likely.

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:09.230
Why would that happen?

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:10.800
Well, just very briefly,

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:14.020
a lateralized eye movements of
the sort that I'm describing

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.260
and I'm moving my hand like this

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.310
but I'll just do it with my eyes

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:19.000
even though it's a little
embarrassing to do that.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.980
Cause I know it looks
strange, I don't mind

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:25.340
cause I'm doing EMDR and
EMDR reduces activation

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.660
of the amygdala and related circuitries

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:32.000
which reduces anxiety
and reduces the amplitude

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.750
of the threat reflex.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:36.530
Reduces sympathetic autonomic arousal.

01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:40.290
In other words, we feel
calmer or we feel less alert,

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:43.223
less stressed when moving
our eyes from side to side.

01:08:44.806 --> 01:08:47.220
I just heard a story about this is that

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:48.710
these are the sorts of
eye movements that we do

01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:50.910
when we are ambulating,
moving through space,

01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:53.120
through some sort of
self-generated motion.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:58.120
And one can make up a
pretty reasonable story

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:01.120
in the evolutionary context
or ecological context

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.790
that forward movement and fear

01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:07.130
are generally incompatible
with one another.

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:09.380
That generally a fear
response involves a freezing

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:10.580
or a retreating.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.670
Some people will advance,

01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:14.590
but that's usually a trained
advance in response to fear

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:16.060
so first responders and so forth.

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.650
Most people freeze or
retreat when they're afraid.

01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:20.690
Forward movement generates
these eye movements.

01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:24.960
It does seem to suppress
activation of this threat reflex

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.780
and the amygdala in particular.

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:31.780
So for the many EMDR
practitioners out there

01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:35.460
these papers I think
are a great celebration.

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:39.570
And I think there is now
increasing excitement about EMDR

01:09:39.570 --> 01:09:42.610
in the psychiatric and
psychological community

01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:47.610
for its utility, for treating
fear, trauma and PTSD.

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:50.910
However, I should point
out that in discussing EMDR

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:53.490
with various colleagues of
mine at Stanford and elsewhere,

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:57.130
I was told that EMDR has
been shown to be beneficial

01:09:57.130 --> 01:10:00.340
in particular for single
event type traumas

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.000
or fearful experiences.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.740
Not so much for relieving the trauma

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.340
or feelings of fear associated.

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.580
For instance, with an entire bad marriage

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:10.800
or an entire childhood.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.880
But more for single more acute
events that can be described

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.483
within a very kind of brief narrative.

01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:22.250
Brief, not necessarily in time,
but that the car accident,

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:24.830
the bad interaction
with another individual,

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:27.460
the assault, God forbid,
these sorts of things.

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:31.130
And I realize we're down
in the weeds of topics

01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:32.700
that are unpleasant.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:35.050
And so I have great sensitivity to that

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:36.950
but I think it's also
important that we be realistic

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:39.120
about the kinds of things
that traumatize people.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:42.210
So is EMDR useful?

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:46.260
Well, it seems like it
works for these single event

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:49.040
or kind of constrained event type traumas

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.230
that people can describe

01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:52.420
while moving their eyes from side to side

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.960
generally in the presence of a clinician.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.970
However, if we think back to the model

01:10:56.970 --> 01:11:00.910
of how you extinguish and
then replace a trauma or fear,

01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:03.620
remember you have to
diminish the old experience

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.960
the amplitude of that.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.793
You need to...

01:11:05.793 --> 01:11:07.860
That's the extinguish portion.

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.810
Then you need to relearn a new narrative

01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:13.810
and attach reward to
the old traumatic event.

01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:18.560
EMDR only really taps into the extinction

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:23.440
of the physiological response
to the old experience.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.330
I'm sure that there are
EMDR practitioners out there

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:27.930
that are thinking about the attaching

01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:29.940
of the new narrative and reward,

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.670
but there I've heard less

01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:35.930
and I've seen fewer
peer-reviewed papers on that.

01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:37.360
So let's think about this logically.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.590
Let's say, and indeed it's the case

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:41.810
that I'm sitting down in a chair

01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:43.550
and moving eyes side to side deliberately

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:44.520
for some period of time

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.773
reduces activation of the threat reflex.

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:51.330
I or the patient in this case,

01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:55.780
recites or repeats over and
over the traumatic event

01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:57.380
or the fearful event.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.810
I'm doing that in the presence

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:03.620
of a lower amplitude response.

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.910
Remember back to where we
talked about how the retelling

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:10.870
works best if the first time it's done

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:13.100
there's a huge amplitude response.

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.412
And then with each successive
repeat that response

01:12:15.412 --> 01:12:18.540
the threat response gets lower and lower.

01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:20.540
With EMDR, you're sort of short circuiting

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.310
you're kind of sneaking around the corner

01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:24.150
of that high amplitude response.

01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:26.710
And so it's taking a
somewhat different approach

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:30.750
of trying to extinguish the bad feelings

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.380
in body and mind associated
with an experience

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:38.050
by reducing the physiological response.

01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:39.110
So it's somewhat different.

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:42.740
And at least to my knowledge
and EMDR practitioners

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.920
please correct me, but
at least to my knowledge,

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.240
there isn't an active component to EMDR

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.310
of relearning a new narrative
and attaching reward.

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:55.810
Now reward and attaching reward requires

01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:59.550
a somewhat high amplitude
sympathetic arousal.

01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:03.600
It requires a feeling of a
victory which is arousal, okay?

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.490
It's positive arousal,
not negative arousal,

01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:06.720
but it is arousal.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:09.480
So I'm not focusing on
this to try and diminish

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.430
the potential impact of EMDR.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:14.960
I know many people have
achieved great relief from EMDR

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.440
but it doesn't tap into all
the aspects of the extinction

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.720
and relearning that we
talked about previously.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.290
And therefore, I think on its own

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:27.080
at least in many cases is
unlikely to be a complete therapy

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.320
for fear and trauma.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.700
If there are people out there
who've had terrific results

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.610
with the EMDR, please let us
know in the comment section,

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:36.460
on YouTube would be the ideal place.

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.840
If you've had bad experiences with EMDR

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.190
or it didn't work for
you also let us know.

01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:44.400
I think that EMDR practitioners
like most practitioners

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.250
in the psychiatric and psychological space

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:48.750
are eager to expand their practices

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:50.180
in order to make them more effective

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:54.670
rather than clinging
ardently to something that

01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:56.410
perhaps is incomplete or that doesn't work

01:13:56.410 --> 01:13:57.350
for certain individuals.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:14:00.060
So I think they would appreciate
that feedback as would I.

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.110
So, as I mentioned before,

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:02.880
most of these therapies
are done in conjunction

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.880
with a skilled often one would
hope credentialed clinician.

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:11.180
There are many people however,

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.810
that don't have access to that

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:15.200
or who are working through stuff.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.140
They have things in their past

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.190
that are very uncomfortable to them.

01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:21.490
And I'm aware that many people are working

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:22.410
through those things.

01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:24.893
Through journaling, through
talking to a friend,

01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:27.250
through any number of different

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:29.810
sort of non-traditional approaches.

01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:32.440
One thing that really
pertains to everybody

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.620
who's working through fear
and trauma of any kind

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:38.960
is the importance of social connection

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.580
as it relates to the chemical systems

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:44.470
and the neural circuits
associated with fear and trauma.

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:47.500
And this is a emerging
literature in Neuroscience

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.830
that is really a beautiful one because

01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:51.840
it's a very conserved biology.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.700
We see it, believe it or not
in flies and fruit flies,

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.740
a commonly used model system.

01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:59.930
In mice and indeed in humans as well.

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:03.830
And this is the work of David
Anderson's group at Caltech,

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:08.770
again, of Dr. Ressler's
group at Harvard Medical

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:10.540
and elsewhere, of course.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:14.340
And this is the work as
it relates to Tachykinin.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:19.280
Tachykinin is a very interesting
molecule in our brain

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.420
and it turns out the
Tachykinin is activated

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:26.420
in neurons of what's
called the central amygdala

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.100
and some nearby structures.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:32.443
So really smack dab within the
middle of this threat reflex.

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:36.570
Very soon after some traumatic

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:39.090
or fear inducing event occurs.

01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:42.050
And it actually sets in motion
a number of other things

01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:46.800
including changes in gene
expression and potentiation

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.350
meaning long-term potentiation,

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:50.960
activation of an NMDA receptors and so on.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.780
In the circuits that
reinforce that fearful

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.470
or traumatic experience.

01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:57.240
Now what's interesting about Tachykinin

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.730
is also that it's been shown to lead

01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:03.240
to low to moderate levels of anxiety

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:07.430
and even kind of aggression, irritability.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:12.430
Tachykinin levels are further
increased by social isolation.

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:18.440
And that social isolation is
oftentimes what can exacerbate

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.470
pre-existing traumas or fearful events.

01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:24.400
And in a kind of
beautiful symmetry to that

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.363
kind of dark and depressing story,

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:30.830
social connection with
people that we trust.

01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:32.730
And it doesn't have to be
direct physical contact

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:35.913
but just social connection
conversing with,

01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:38.830
sharing a meal with,

01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:41.240
it could be physical touch
if that's appropriate.

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:45.690
Those sorts of connections
actually serve to reduce

01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:48.980
the effectiveness or even
the levels of Tachykinin.

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.010
So the important point here is that

01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:54.910
trauma is traumatic in and of itself.

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:58.350
Fearful events are hard
in and of themselves.

01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:59.760
And if people are working through them

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:03.120
either through clinical work
or through individual work.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.400
It is important and in ideally

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.150
one would still be trying
to access social connection

01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:14.660
outside of that specific
work-related to the trauma.

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:17.020
Now it doesn't necessarily
have to be outside of that.

01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:19.680
For instance, if you
have a good relationship

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.950
with a clinician or therapist

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:22.710
to the point where there's real trust

01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:25.940
and you feel a social
connection with them, wonderful.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:26.773
But for many people,

01:17:26.773 --> 01:17:29.870
they have a more
transactional relationship

01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:34.110
to the EMDR practitioner
or to their therapist,

01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:36.050
or they're working through
things on their own.

01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:38.400
And it's really important to understand

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.920
that regular social connection,

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.970
trusting social connection of any kind

01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:46.350
is going to be very
beneficial for that process.

01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:49.150
And so this is not the
kind of just hand-wavy,

01:17:49.150 --> 01:17:50.427
a new agey stuff like,

01:17:50.427 --> 01:17:52.290
"Oh, you know you need social connection."

01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:56.490
There's a actual neurochemical
basis for social isolation

01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:59.400
that has an amplifying
effect on fear and trauma.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.210
And there is a neurochemical
basis for the relief

01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:06.030
from fear and trauma and isolation.

01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:07.650
And in the ideal circumstance,

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:09.850
one is working through
these traumas and fears

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:12.160
very intensely in a very dedicated way.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.070
But then is also engaging

01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:15.960
in the sorts of social interactions

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.300
that are going to diminish
the amount of Tachykinin

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:21.210
and going to suppress those very circuits

01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:23.330
that would otherwise be amplified.

01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:26.640
So next I'd like to talk
about some really interesting

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:29.720
and almost kind of eerie
scientific findings.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.730
And that's the transgenerational
passage of trauma

01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:36.800
or predisposition to fear and trauma.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.580
This is a scientific
literature that's been debated

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:43.440
many times over the last
really 50 plus years.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.730
But in more recent
studies have really proven

01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:52.020
that we as humans have
the capacity to inherit

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:56.060
a predisposition to trauma or fear.

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:59.060
Now that doesn't necessarily
mean that we will become

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:01.570
traumatized or experience extreme fear

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.690
just because our parents or
grandparents experienced that.

01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:07.720
It's a predisposition, it's a bias.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.950
Let me explain the
papers that focus on this

01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:11.783
for a little bit.

01:19:11.783 --> 01:19:14.490
And then we'll talk about what
this means for each of us.

01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:17.130
One of the most important
papers in this area

01:19:17.130 --> 01:19:19.660
comes to us from someone
I mentioned earlier,

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.710
Dr. Kerry Ressler at Harvard.

01:19:21.710 --> 01:19:23.100
And the title of the paper is,

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:27.790
Association of FKBP5
polymorphisms and childhood abuse

01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:30.540
with risk of posttraumatic
stress disorder symptoms

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:31.920
in adults.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.963
And there are other papers as well.

01:19:34.930 --> 01:19:36.140
Another one from the Ressler's Lab,

01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:39.810
first author, Brian Dias, D-I-A-S.

01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:42.510
Parental olfactory experience
influences behavior

01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:44.880
and neural structure in
subsequent generations.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.320
I'm going to summarize these
papers and their general contour

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.850
and papers related to them.

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:51.720
Although, feel free to look up
the papers I just described.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.780
We will provide a link
to them in the caption

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.160
if you'd like to go further.

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.830
But basically these explorations involve

01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:02.310
looking at the histories
of human individuals

01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:08.350
who had trauma or abuse of
some kind in their childhood.

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:11.690
And then looking at the likelihood of fear

01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:15.590
and PTSD type symptomology
in their offspring.

01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:19.450
And essentially what they
identified is that indeed,

01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:21.480
if you had a parent and there does seem

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.400
to be a kind of a bias
toward an effect where

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:29.400
if the father had abuse
and it's severe abuse

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.170
or moderate abuse.

01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:38.170
That abuse causes a
change in his genetics,

01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:43.550
in his sperm that can be
passed on to offspring

01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:46.800
such that the offspring
have a lower threshold

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.860
to develop trauma or extreme fear

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:51.510
to certain types of events.

01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:55.490
Now what's important to point
out is that predisposition

01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:59.440
or bias is not necessarily
to the same sorts of events.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.220
It's not that the abuse itself gets passed

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:05.350
from one generation to the
next it's a predisposition.

01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:07.470
And the title of that paper mentioned,

01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:12.470
FKB5, excuse me, FKBP5 polymorphisms.

01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:17.890
And the FKBP5 polymorphisms
maps to a location

01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:20.150
in the genome that's associated

01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:22.210
with the so-called glucocorticoid system

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.610
with cortisol release.

01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:27.750
So the predisposition
that one might inherit

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:29.860
from having a parent father or mother

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:33.270
but stronger tendency to
inherit it from the father.

01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:35.660
Who experienced abuse is one in which

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:38.710
the glucocorticoid system,
the cortisol system,

01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:41.370
and that HPA axis that
we talked about before

01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:45.467
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis is sensitized

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.860
or reactive in a way that
sets a lower threshold

01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:53.330
to become traumatized or very afraid

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:54.420
of certain types of events.

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:57.990
But it's not unique to
the specific type of abuse

01:21:57.990 --> 01:22:00.520
that the parent experienced.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.210
Now, this is really, really important

01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:03.480
because a lot of times out there

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:06.170
I will hear that there's passage

01:22:06.170 --> 01:22:08.780
or transgenerational
passage of actual trauma,

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:09.950
the specific trauma.

01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:13.590
Now that could be through
narrative telling,

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:16.610
if somebody is exposed
to a lot of narrative

01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:19.640
about their parents' trauma
in one form or another.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.780
It may be that they start to internalize

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:23.410
some of that trauma.

01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:26.880
And there could be because we
obviously can't rule it out.

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.580
There could be some other signatures

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:31.880
of prior specific traumas they
get passed on to offspring.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.680
But more likely and
certainly what these data

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.150
about these polymorphisms point to

01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:40.800
is that what gets passed
on is a propensity

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:45.190
for the threat reflex to
get activated and attached

01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:50.190
to a wider variety or to
less intense types of inputs

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:51.980
and experiences.

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.370
And the important point
to take away from this

01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:58.840
is that it's not some magical, mysterious,

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:01.510
and mystical thing
that's being transplanted

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:03.150
from parent to child.

01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:08.150
It's a gene or it's a
modification in a set of genes

01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:11.560
that gives a heightened
level of responsivity

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.290
to fearful type events.

01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:15.030
Or even a high level of responsivity

01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:18.270
such that things that
wouldn't be fear inducing

01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:20.630
or trauma inducing to certain individuals

01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:23.550
can trigger fear and
trauma in these children

01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:26.020
that inherit this particular gene.

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:29.070
Now that doesn't necessarily
mean that they are faded

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:31.220
to forever be traumatized or live in fear.

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:32.410
It's simply not the case.

01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:34.700
It's just a genetic predisposition

01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:37.790
regardless of whether or not
you had a parent or parents

01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:39.763
that were traumatized or not.

01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:43.820
There's no evidence, at
least as far as I'm aware

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:47.170
that the treatments for trauma
should be any different.

01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:49.590
As far as I know there
aren't gene therapies

01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:52.650
currently aimed at these
particular variants,

01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:57.650
like FKBP5 and so forth that
could reverse those particular

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.520
genetic underpinnings of
the trauma predisposition.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.373
So this transgenerational
passage of trauma,

01:24:06.373 --> 01:24:09.730
I think is extremely
interesting in large part

01:24:09.730 --> 01:24:11.570
because it brings us back to this idea

01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:16.570
that the threat reflux is part
of a larger sensory system.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:19.210
You know, normally we think
of seeing as a sensory system

01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:21.030
or hearing as a sensory system.

01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:24.640
But the threat detection
and threat learning system,

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.173
the fear learning system is
in many ways a sensory system.

01:24:28.173 --> 01:24:31.000
It's just a sensory system
that is very generic

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:31.833
in its response.

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.440
That generic response again is good

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.150
because it allows for flexibility

01:24:35.150 --> 01:24:38.860
but it's bad because it
reduces specificity, right?

01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:40.410
We can essentially become fearful

01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:43.430
or traumatized by anything if
the circuit gets activated.

01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:46.890
And these particular children
inherit a predisposition

01:24:46.890 --> 01:24:50.460
for more things and less intense
things to traumatize them.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.620
In a few minutes, we are going to discuss

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.220
some of the behavioral treatments

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.910
including some really
new exciting protocols

01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:59.470
for dealing with fear and trauma.

01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:01.180
But for a few minutes,

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:03.060
I'd like to discuss some
of the drug treatments

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:06.160
that are starting to emerge
as potential therapeutics

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.550
in particular for PTSD.

01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:10.890
The two drug treatments
I'd like to focus on

01:25:10.890 --> 01:25:13.630
are Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy,

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:17.420
and MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:20.280
Currently Ketamine-Assisted
Psychotherapy is legal.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:23.130
It is approved, provided it is prescribed

01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:26.360
by a board certified physician
in the United States.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:30.090
I'm not certain about
other areas of the world.

01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:34.440
MDMA also sometimes called Ecstasy therapy

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.070
is in clinical trials in the U S,

01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:40.860
it is still an illegal
drug to possess or to sell.

01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:43.220
So I want to be very clear about that.

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:45.340
However, MDMA is being explored

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:48.820
as a potential therapeutic for PTSD

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:50.550
and other forms of trauma.

01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:53.050
And of course, Ketamine and MDMA

01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:56.230
are also both being explored
for chronic depression,

01:25:56.230 --> 01:25:58.190
eating disorders and a number of other

01:25:58.190 --> 01:26:00.360
psychiatric disorders.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.890
But for the moment I would
just like to touch on

01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:06.590
Ketamine and MDMA as they relate

01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:09.650
to the fear circuitry and trauma circuitry

01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:13.050
that we've described in the
early part of the episode

01:26:13.050 --> 01:26:14.070
and throughout the episode.

01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:17.650
Because I think that in
viewing them through that lens,

01:26:17.650 --> 01:26:19.250
we can gain some additional insight

01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:22.070
into how they might be
providing the sorts of relief

01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:23.670
that some of the early clinical studies

01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:25.010
are starting to point to.

01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:28.670
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.

01:26:28.670 --> 01:26:29.503
That's right.

01:26:29.503 --> 01:26:30.840
It's a dissociative anesthetic.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:35.380
It's main function is to
create a state of dissociation.

01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:37.240
And I've never taken ketamine personally

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:40.310
so I can't describe the experience of it.

01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:43.080
But a colleague of mine in psychiatry

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:48.000
shared their experience with
a patient's experience of it

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.547
as making that patient feel as if,

01:26:51.547 --> 01:26:56.220
"They were getting out of
the cockpit of a plane,

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.820
but that they were observing
themselves doing it."

01:26:58.820 --> 01:26:59.780
And this was of course,

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:03.260
during a approved therapeutic session

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.950
that they were doing this

01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:07.920
and they were in some sort
of intense visualization

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.500
about a traumatic experience.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.540
They were describing some
of their depressive symptoms

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:12.900
as well as the trauma.

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:16.630
And their narrative that
they basically created

01:27:16.630 --> 01:27:17.510
or took away from this.

01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:20.480
And that was relayed
to me was one in which

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.270
the patient felt like they
were in their own body

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:26.240
but they were also viewing
their own body from the outside.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.250
So dissociative, in other words.

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:31.170
Again, I've never had this experience.

01:27:31.170 --> 01:27:34.970
Some of you may have with
Ketamine or through other means.

01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:37.760
But we might want to just
take a moment and think about

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.520
what Ketamine actually does

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.130
and what dissociation actually does

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:43.580
at the level of neurocircuits?

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:46.620
And for that, we can look to
this really beautiful paper

01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:48.210
that was published by my colleagues,

01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:50.630
Karl Deisseroth in psychiatry,

01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:52.860
Robert Malenka, also in
psychiatry, Liqun Luo,

01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:54.593
also at Stanford.

01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:58.960
They paired up or teamed
up rather to explore

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:03.390
how systemic Ketamine adjust
circuitries in the brain.

01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:05.570
And what they discovered was that

01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:08.170
it changes the rhythm of cortical activity

01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:11.170
in certain layers of the cortex.

01:28:11.170 --> 01:28:14.070
The cortex is like a layered sandwich.

01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:16.690
The cortex of course, being
the outside of the brain.

01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:17.970
And there was a particular rhythm

01:28:17.970 --> 01:28:19.440
a one to three hertz rhythm.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.470
One to three hertz just
means a particular frequency

01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:23.450
of electrical activity.

01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:24.283
In this case,

01:28:24.283 --> 01:28:26.800
in these layer 5 neurons
of Retrosplenial cortex.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.320
So you don't need to know much
about Retrosplenial cortex

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:32.350
or a one to three hertz rhythms.

01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:34.820
I think the important thing
to just take away from this

01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:39.140
is that there is now starting
to be an understanding

01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:41.040
of how drugs like Ketamine work

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:46.040
to create this subjective
experience that this patient

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.563
and other patients
describe as dissociation.

01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:52.650
You know, dissociation in its essence

01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:57.090
is really about not
feeling what's happening.

01:28:57.090 --> 01:28:59.020
It's about viewing what's happening

01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.700
from a different perspective
than what normally

01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.770
one would view that experience from.

01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:08.480
And so if we add a plug that
general notion of dissociation

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.300
and Ketamine induced
association into the circuit

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.320
that we talked about before,

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.720
where we have this threat
reflex involving the amygdala.

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:18.630
These outputs for freezing or
for reward and the accumbens.

01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:21.930
And we've got this prefrontal
narrative coming down

01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:23.750
as top-down processing.

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:27.510
It brings us right to that
prefrontal cortical input

01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:29.900
to the threat system and that narrative.

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:33.550
What seems to be the case
in my review of the paper

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:34.460
I just described,

01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:38.720
plus a review on how
Ketamine-assisted trauma relief

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:43.000
might work is that it
somehow allows the patient,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.470
the individual to recount
their trauma while feeling

01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:52.470
either none or a very different
set of emotional experiences

01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:55.510
that they experienced in the actual trauma

01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:57.050
or fearful experience.

01:29:57.050 --> 01:30:00.650
So it's a remapping of new onto old.

01:30:00.650 --> 01:30:03.820
New meaning new feelings onto
old feelings while staying

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.150
in the exact same narrative.

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:08.010
So it's a little bit
like EMDR of suppressing

01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:12.480
the threat reflex but it seems
to bring in a replacement

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:17.450
of previous emotional
experiences and sensations

01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:20.130
in the body with new ones.

01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:23.000
And so in that way we can sort of view

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.330
or we can try and view
Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy

01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:28.800
for the treatment of
trauma as bringing together

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.970
the three elements that
we talked about before.

01:30:30.970 --> 01:30:33.360
You want to diminish the intensity,

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:37.120
the potency of the old
original trauma experience

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:38.320
or fear experience.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.220
So that seems to be accomplished
through this dissociation

01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:43.290
and maybe through the kind
of anesthetic component.

01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:46.630
So it's a reduction in pain
in the body, a dissociation,

01:30:46.630 --> 01:30:50.610
a kind of observing of the self
that leads to the extinction

01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:52.250
of the trauma and the fear.

01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:54.950
But then there also
seems to be an automatic

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:58.363
or kind of built in a
relearning of a new narrative,

01:30:58.363 --> 01:31:01.140
a new set of experiences
which is the next step

01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:02.900
that we described earlier.

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:05.240
So it's an intriguing therapy.

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:07.240
It's one that's really catching on

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:09.280
and there are many, many
clinics around the U S

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.070
that are now doing it.

01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:14.250
Whether or not it turns out
to be the ultimate treatment

01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:17.760
for trauma and for fear isn't clear.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:21.450
My colleagues in psychiatry
tell me that that's unlikely,

01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:23.330
although it does seem to be beneficial

01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:24.370
for a number of people.

01:31:24.370 --> 01:31:27.230
Especially people that
are experiencing trauma

01:31:27.230 --> 01:31:28.970
or have existing traumas and fear

01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:30.880
that are coupled with depressive symptoms.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.350
Because the data on
Ketamine and depression

01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:34.830
seems to be quite strong.

01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:37.350
So now let's talk about MDMA.

01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:41.190
MDMA also sometimes
called Ecstasy or Molly

01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:46.050
in its recreational form is
a powerful synthetic drug

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:49.420
that at least as far as we know,

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:53.390
creates a state in the brain
and body that is unlike

01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:55.540
any other chemical state
in the brain and body

01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:57.030
that's normally experienced.

01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:58.250
What do I mean by that?

01:31:58.250 --> 01:32:01.150
Well, we have several
Neuromodulator systems in our body.

01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:03.950
Neuromodulators are chemicals
that change the likelihood

01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:06.200
that certain neural
circuits will be active.

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.640
Meaning they can make it very
likely that certain circuits

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.890
will be active and make it
very unlikely that other

01:32:10.890 --> 01:32:12.830
neural circuits will be active.

01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:16.400
Good examples of neuromodulators
are dopamine, serotonin,

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.410
acetylcholine, norepinephrine.

01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:20.480
These tend to work on different systems

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:23.330
in the brain and body but
they tend to be activated

01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:24.670
more or less in parallel, right?

01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:27.280
You can have Dopamine
released in your brain

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.960
and also Norepinephrine.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.850
You can have Serotonin
released in your brain

01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:32.130
and also Acetylcholine.

01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:34.160
So it's not an all or none kind of thing,

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.550
but the degrees to which
these things are activated

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:37.810
tends to vary.

01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:42.790
And there is a little bit
of a seesaw type phenomenon

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:44.310
with Dopamine and Serotonin.

01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:47.840
Dopamine most commonly
associated with activating

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:51.450
neurocircuits related to
motivation, craving, and reward.

01:32:51.450 --> 01:32:54.410
And Serotonin more typically activated

01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:57.820
in response to situations or conditions

01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:00.230
in which we are very happy
and content with what we have.

01:33:00.230 --> 01:33:02.490
So Dopamine is more about
pursuing and seeking.

01:33:02.490 --> 01:33:07.490
Serotonin is more about kind
of pleasure and satisfaction

01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:10.450
with resources that we have
in our immediate sphere.

01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:11.580
They don't tend to...

01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:13.990
Serotonin doesn't tend to
place the brain and body

01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:15.980
into a mode of action

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:19.053
quite as much as Dopamine
does, more or less.

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:24.470
MDMA is a unique compound in that it leads

01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:27.450
to very large increases
in the amount of both

01:33:27.450 --> 01:33:31.800
Dopamine and Serotonin in the
brain and body simultaneously.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:36.050
And that's a unique circumstance
that is just simply not

01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:38.170
seen under normal conditions.

01:33:38.170 --> 01:33:39.800
From a subjective standpoint,

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:41.870
people under the influence of MDMA

01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:43.890
in the therapeutic setting,

01:33:43.890 --> 01:33:47.880
tend to report immense feelings
of connection or resonance

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:52.290
with people or even things
with music, with objects.

01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:55.810
Certainly if it's being
done in conjunction

01:33:55.810 --> 01:33:59.730
with a family member or a
partner or with a therapist,

01:33:59.730 --> 01:34:02.770
they will feel extremely
connected to that person.

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:06.340
They'll feel a very close
understanding and association.

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.810
Oftentimes that goes beyond words.

01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:10.883
There is a chemical reason for that.

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:16.980
It turns out that MDMA causes
massive release of oxytocin.

01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:21.180
This neuropeptide that's
associated with pair bonding

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:22.600
and with bonding generally.

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.500
The oxytocin system and
the Serotonin system

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.420
are closely linked to one
another in the brain and body.

01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:32.150
And they tend to be co-released
often at the same times

01:34:32.150 --> 01:34:33.850
and by the same sorts of events.

01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:38.850
So MDMA is one mechanism by
which oxytocin is released

01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:41.910
in these massive amounts.

01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:45.530
And I should just relay some
of the levels of oxytocin

01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:47.050
because they're really quite striking,

01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:51.460
gives a kind of a more vivid
picture of why it is the MDMA

01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:55.760
would make people feel so
associated in a positive way

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.640
with the various things
that are happening them

01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.880
while they're under the
influence of the drug.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.870
So the paper related to this
that I'd like to highlight

01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:06.580
is in the journal
Psychoneuroendocrinology.

01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:09.900
The title of the paper is
Plasma oxytocin concentrations

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:14.260
following MDMA or intranasal
oxytocin in humans.

01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:19.260
And just remarkably MDMA
increased plasma oxytocin levels

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:25.600
to 83.7, this is an average,
83.7 picograms per milliliter.

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.290
About 90 to 120 minutes
into the MDMA session

01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:34.630
compared to a typical level of 18.6.

01:35:34.630 --> 01:35:37.200
So this is a massive increase in oxytocin.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.780
And I think that massive
increase in oxytocin

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:43.270
is part of the reason
why people have these

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:46.650
feelings of close
resonance and association.

01:35:46.650 --> 01:35:50.300
Now, the Dopamine increases
are generally what lead

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:53.980
to the feelings of euphoria
inside of the MDMA session.

01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:56.680
And then the Serotonin
increases it is thought

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.210
are what lead to the feelings
of safety and comfort.

01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:01.420
So again, a very unusual chemical cocktail

01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:05.140
that would never be seen at
least not at this amplitude

01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:09.460
under any normal conditions
outside of an MDMA

01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:12.120
clinical psychotherapeutic session.

01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:16.150
Why would this state of mind
and body be potentially useful

01:36:16.150 --> 01:36:17.880
for the treatment of trauma?

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:21.270
Well, indeed it is revealing
itself to be useful

01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:22.170
for the treatment of trauma.

01:36:22.170 --> 01:36:24.810
Again, these are legal clinical trials

01:36:24.810 --> 01:36:27.700
where people are doing
this and discovering this.

01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:32.700
What it seems to allow
is a very fast relearning

01:36:33.190 --> 01:36:37.140
or new associations to be tacked on

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:39.180
to the previously traumatic experience.

01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:41.640
So again, it brings us
back to the same model

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:45.240
of how people extinguish fears and traumas

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.380
and replace them with new experiences

01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:49.430
when there is no drug treatment involved.

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:53.160
There needs to be a diminishing
of the old experience,

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:54.960
meaning an extinction
and then a relearning

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:55.970
of a new narrative.

01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:59.260
What the chemical [indistinct] of MDMA

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:02.600
seems to be doing is
creating an opportunity

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.410
for all that to happen very fast

01:37:05.410 --> 01:37:08.660
without the need for many
repetitions of the original trauma

01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:11.110
and reliving of the original trauma.

01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:13.850
Probably because the reliving of it inside

01:37:13.850 --> 01:37:18.850
of one of these MDMA sessions
is very acute, very intense,

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:22.570
plus it seems to be
offering the opportunity

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:26.170
to extinguish and rewrite in or write in

01:37:26.170 --> 01:37:28.910
a new narrative associated
with that trauma

01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:30.380
very quickly as well.

01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:33.570
So what this means is
that treatments like MDMA

01:37:33.570 --> 01:37:36.400
that are under investigation
in these clinical trials

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:41.170
are unlikely to be magic
potions, if you will,

01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:45.260
that allow access to a particular process

01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:48.780
that would otherwise not be accessible.

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:52.010
It's more that the
typical process of trauma

01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:54.180
and fear reduction that's
carried out in things like

01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:56.010
prolonged exposure, cognitive processing,

01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.810
cognitive behavioral therapy
seems to be compacted

01:37:58.810 --> 01:38:00.280
into a much shorter session.

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:04.180
And that session is performed
at a much higher intensity.

01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:05.850
Higher intensity because
the chemical [indistinct]

01:38:05.850 --> 01:38:09.050
of the brain is completely different.

01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:12.880
I mean, the experience of
MDMA is one in which people

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:15.070
have a very heightened sense of euphoria,

01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:16.940
very heightened sense of connection.

01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:19.980
So those positive experiences
are essentially primed

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:22.860
to be written in and over
the traumatic experience

01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:26.480
and because of the high levels
of Serotonin in the system

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.160
and probably oxytocin as well,

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:31.350
there's a safety that's
written into the situation

01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:34.740
that allows people to lean
into perhaps narratives

01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:35.920
or components of narratives

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:38.550
that they would otherwise
be holding back from.

01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:40.510
So these are powerful compounds,

01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:43.950
and I think the future of
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy

01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:48.530
for a trauma in particular
is holding great promise.

01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:51.090
As of now, meaning at
the time of the recording

01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:51.923
of this podcast.

01:38:51.923 --> 01:38:55.040
Again, I want to reiterate
that these are clinical trials

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.040
are being done legally.

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:59.280
These drugs are still
illegal to possess or sell

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.680
outside of clinical trials.

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:04.880
Doing this sort of thing is punishable.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:09.880
But it does seem that the FDA
and some of the related bodies

01:39:10.298 --> 01:39:12.530
that control these sorts of things

01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:14.690
are eyes open to this stuff.

01:39:14.690 --> 01:39:16.800
And I think it's very likely
in the next few years,

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:20.440
things like MDMA and
certainly Ketamine has already

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.720
in widespread use within
the psychiatric community.

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:25.070
And I think we're going to
be seeing a lot more of that.

01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:27.620
One thing we have not touched on yet

01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:30.840
is how do you know if you're traumatized?

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:34.140
How do you know if you have chronic fear

01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:36.260
or a debilitating fear?

01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:38.500
You know, much of the
psychiatric community

01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:43.370
focuses on how many other
problems people might have.

01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:46.550
Trouble sleeping, trouble eating,

01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:50.510
trouble maintaining
quality work, or schoolwork

01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:51.343
and so forth.

01:39:51.343 --> 01:39:54.690
And all of those are
certainly very valid criteria

01:39:54.690 --> 01:39:56.490
and necessary criteria for determining

01:39:56.490 --> 01:40:01.040
whether or not somebody meets
a clinical diagnosis or not.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.950
But there's a biological component

01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:07.180
that I think we can all
assess for ourselves.

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:09.489
And that's one of

01:40:09.489 --> 01:40:12.310
interoceptive versus
exteroception balance.

01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:13.240
And that sounds confusing,

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:16.120
but it's actually really
easy to understand.

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:20.780
We can focus our perception
on the external world,

01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:23.950
events going on around us,
beyond the confines of our skin

01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:26.960
or within the confines of our skin.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.080
A focus and a perception
on the external world

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.650
is what's called exteroception

01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:35.420
and a focus on what's happening
inside us is interoception.

01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:39.820
And we have the capacity
to build mental appraisal

01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:40.800
into that, right?

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.420
I can for instance, stop
for a moment and assess

01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:45.900
how my stomach feels, how hungry I feel,

01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:47.660
how quick my heart is beating.

01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:49.500
Some people by the way
are much better at sensing

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:52.360
whether or not their heart is
beating at a particular rate

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.580
and others, not so much.

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:55.530
Some people can actually
count their heartbeats without

01:40:55.530 --> 01:40:58.570
having to take their
pulse by placing pressure

01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:00.580
on their wrist or their neck.

01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:01.710
Some people can't.

01:41:01.710 --> 01:41:03.440
In other words, some people have very high

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:06.700
interoceptive awareness
and other people less so.

01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:10.800
This whole business of fear
and trauma relates to taking

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:15.800
external experiences and
funneling those experiences

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:19.670
into this thing that I'm
calling a threat reflux

01:41:19.670 --> 01:41:21.063
or the fear circuitry.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.620
A recent paper published
in the journal Science.

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:28.500
So absolutely spectacular
journal, science, nature and cell

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:31.453
being the apex journals
of scientific publishing.

01:41:32.490 --> 01:41:36.080
Gets at this issue of where in our mind

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.660
and how do we assess whether or not

01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:42.850
what we are feeling
internally is reasonable

01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:44.750
given what's going on externally.

01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:46.650
And it's a really fascinating study.

01:41:46.650 --> 01:41:49.310
I'm just going to highlight
a little bit of it for you

01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:52.340
and then I'll touch on some
of the relevant aspects

01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:55.260
and how that can be
adopted into a practice

01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:59.080
to assess and reduce fear and anxiety.

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.830
The title of this paper
published just a few weeks ago

01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:03.120
in Science is,

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:06.180
Fear balance is maintained
by bodily feedback

01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:08.800
to the insular cortex in mice.

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.100
We've not talked too
much about the insular,

01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.490
also called the insular cortex.

01:42:12.490 --> 01:42:14.610
This is a brain area
that my lab has worked on

01:42:14.610 --> 01:42:16.340
and other labs have worked on.

01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:19.460
It's a brain area that has within it

01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:24.400
a map of our internal
interoceptive landscape.

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:29.050
It's a map of our internal
bodily sensations.

01:42:29.050 --> 01:42:31.640
And it's a really interesting structure.

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:34.500
So the way this study
was carried out is that

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:36.480
subjects were taught or conditioned

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:38.310
to a particular danger signal

01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:41.760
through repeated presentation
of a sound with a foot shock.

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:43.400
So there's a sound and
there's a foot shock.

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.640
And as you know, from
our earlier discussion

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:47.680
about Pavlovian learning,
conditions stimulate,

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:48.910
an unconditioned stimulate.

01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:53.163
Eventually the sound alone comes
to evoke the fear response.

01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:57.900
And that's just classic,
classical conditioning.

01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:00.880
The insular is this brain
area that's associated

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:05.880
with determining whether or
not one's internal sensations,

01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:09.870
gut, heart, lungs, et cetera,

01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:14.060
are reasonable or not given
the external circumstances.

01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:17.650
It can even measure or is associated with

01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:20.920
our understanding of what are
called arterial baroreceptors.

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.530
These are blood pressure sensors.

01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:25.750
So believe or not, when you
know your pulse rate increases

01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:27.530
or you feel like you're stressed out,

01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:30.170
your arterial baroreceptors
are sending a signal

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:32.700
to your insular cortex and
your insular cortex is saying,

01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:34.410
wow, like I'm really stressed out,

01:43:34.410 --> 01:43:35.450
my blood pressure is up, right?

01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:37.040
You don't actually have to
measure your blood pressure

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.450
with a cuff, your insular
is doing it for you.

01:43:39.450 --> 01:43:41.540
It's not getting a quantitative readout,

01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:44.070
but it's getting a qualitative readout.

01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:47.350
The main effect of inhibiting
or reducing the activity

01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:51.500
of the insular was that the intensity

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:56.100
of an outside world
experience led to a range

01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:59.310
of different internal effects.

01:43:59.310 --> 01:44:01.640
In other words, for most people

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:05.780
a mild shock would induce a
mild increase in heart rate,

01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:07.450
a mild increase in blood pressure.

01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:10.380
Whereas an intense shock to the skin

01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:12.060
would lead to a big increase in heart rate

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:13.910
and a big increase in blood pressure.

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:17.560
Turns out the insular is
important for establishing

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:20.590
that match of intensity.

01:44:20.590 --> 01:44:23.240
And when the insular is inhibited,

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:26.640
what ends up happening
is that a mild shock

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.920
can create a big increase
in blood pressure.

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:31.410
And that can be maintained
such that anything

01:44:31.410 --> 01:44:33.987
that's paired with that shock like a bell,

01:44:33.987 --> 01:44:38.150
or a tone would lead to a big
increase in blood pressure.

01:44:38.150 --> 01:44:40.550
You've probably seen examples
of this in the real world.

01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:41.950
Maybe this is even you.

01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:45.090
Some people are very jumpy in response

01:44:45.090 --> 01:44:47.410
to just even small changes
in their environment.

01:44:47.410 --> 01:44:49.320
So if somebody is working and you walk in

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:50.153
and you say, "Hello."

01:44:50.153 --> 01:44:51.750
And they'll go, they're jumpy.

01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:56.750
They have a low threshold to a
big anxiety or fear response.

01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:58.510
Other people are really calm.

01:44:58.510 --> 01:45:01.170
I recall my bulldog,
unfortunately passed away,

01:45:01.170 --> 01:45:02.610
but before he passed away,

01:45:02.610 --> 01:45:05.730
if you walked in the room
and he said, "Hey, Costello."

01:45:05.730 --> 01:45:09.040
He might turn his eyes in your direction.

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:11.450
He had a very high threshold to respond.

01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:13.820
He was pretty low anxiety animal.

01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:15.340
A lot of people are like that.

01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:17.750
You'd come up behind
someone you say, "Hello."

01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:20.300
And they just turn around real slow,

01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:21.850
or they might just turn
around at normal speeds

01:45:21.850 --> 01:45:22.683
and say, "Hello."

01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:24.710
Whereas other people
jump out of their seat.

01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:27.050
The insular seems to be
involved in calibrating

01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:30.860
how big or how high amplitude

01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:32.800
a given physiological response is.

01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.990
So it's pairing the internal landscape

01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:37.630
with the external world.

01:45:37.630 --> 01:45:40.180
And this might seem
like just a mechanistic,

01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:41.650
but non-actionable point.

01:45:41.650 --> 01:45:43.760
But what you'll see from the next study

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:47.360
that I'm going to describe
is that recalibrating

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.950
the relationship between outside events

01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:52.030
and internal responses,

01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:54.620
which is the job of the
insular is actually something

01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:56.250
that's under our control.

01:45:56.250 --> 01:46:00.100
And through a very simple,
very short protocol,

01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:03.820
we can actually recalibrate
that system so much so

01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:07.290
that we can potentially reduce the amount

01:46:07.290 --> 01:46:09.270
of fear and trauma that we experience,

01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:11.760
in response to a memory
or to a real event.

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:15.190
And the entire process
can occur very quickly.

01:46:15.190 --> 01:46:17.860
So I'm really excited to tell
you about this next study

01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:18.693
for a number of reasons.

01:46:18.693 --> 01:46:20.020
First of all, it's extremely recent.

01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:22.640
Second of all, it's very well grounded

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:26.030
in our current understanding
of the mechanisms of stress,

01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:31.030
trauma and PTSD and unlearning
of stress, trauma and PTSD.

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:35.790
And third, it points to
a actionable protocol

01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:39.170
that while certainly is
not the only approach

01:46:39.170 --> 01:46:41.440
that I think people could or should take

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:44.073
for fear, trauma and PTSD.

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:47.610
Is one that I think we are
going to see implemented

01:46:47.610 --> 01:46:50.300
into the clinical setting very soon

01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:51.833
if it's not happening already.

01:46:52.770 --> 01:46:55.600
Now, there's a fourth reason
I'm very interested in it,

01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.360
which is that my lab works on stress,

01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:01.050
stress-relief and tools for managing sleep

01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:03.130
and improving focus, et cetera.

01:47:03.130 --> 01:47:04.770
And one of the hallmarks of the studies

01:47:04.770 --> 01:47:09.730
we've been doing lately is
very brief five minute a day

01:47:09.730 --> 01:47:12.980
interventions of the sort that was used

01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:13.900
in this particular study.

01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:14.940
Although I should emphasize,

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:16.890
I had nothing to do with
this particular study.

01:47:16.890 --> 01:47:18.600
Now this particular study was carried out

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:20.830
in an animal model in mice.

01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:24.230
The work in my laboratory
focuses on human subjects.

01:47:24.230 --> 01:47:27.230
But the similarities of the stress system

01:47:27.230 --> 01:47:29.580
at least at the level that
it was explored in this study

01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:31.210
I think have great relevance

01:47:31.210 --> 01:47:34.550
maybe even direct relevance to humans.

01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:36.410
So the title of this study is,

01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:39.320
Repeated exposure with
short-term behavioral stress

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:42.080
resolves pre-existing stress-induced

01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.900
depressive-like behavior in mice.

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:45.730
Again, this study was in mice.

01:47:45.730 --> 01:47:50.040
And basically what they did
is they stressed out mice,

01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:53.770
got them depressed, and you
actually can do that in a mouse

01:47:53.770 --> 01:47:55.360
using a restraint protocol.

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:57.833
And that's a long lasting
restraint protocol,

01:47:57.833 --> 01:47:59.430
a 15 minutes or more.

01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:01.780
Mice Don't like it,
you do it often enough.

01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:05.210
They stop working so hard in their life,

01:48:05.210 --> 01:48:09.050
in their mouse life to
gain food, to gain mates.

01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:10.900
They show depressive symptoms
in a number of levels.

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:12.330
They show elevated glucocorticoids.

01:48:12.330 --> 01:48:14.250
You see the same thing in humans, Okay?

01:48:14.250 --> 01:48:18.340
Chronic stress in humans
lasting weeks or more

01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:19.610
does the same exact thing.

01:48:19.610 --> 01:48:21.970
So again, a very close match here in terms

01:48:21.970 --> 01:48:23.370
of mechanism overall.

01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:27.080
And then what they did was a
very counterintuitive thing.

01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:31.570
Rather than give these
animals stress relief

01:48:31.570 --> 01:48:34.370
at the level of reducing their anxiety

01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:35.740
with Benzodiazepines,

01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:38.458
or giving them a nice
little mouse vacation,

01:48:38.458 --> 01:48:41.140
or enriched environment.

01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:43.100
Things that have been done
in a lot of previous studies.

01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.870
What they did is they subjected
them to five minutes a day

01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:49.540
of intense stress, but
only five minutes a day.

01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:52.780
And what they found was miraculously,

01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:54.750
but also very convincingly.

01:48:54.750 --> 01:48:59.750
Daily short bouts of intense
stress actually undid,

01:48:59.810 --> 01:49:02.930
reversed the effects of chronic stress.

01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:05.220
And it did this at the
level of glucocorticoids,

01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:06.790
of hormones, of neurotransmitters

01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:08.760
and a number of other
different mechanisms.

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:11.920
Now, I find this very exciting
for a number of reasons

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:15.310
but in particular, because my
laboratory in collaboration

01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:16.590
with David Spiegel laboratory,

01:49:16.590 --> 01:49:18.910
our associate chair of
psychiatry at Stanford.

01:49:18.910 --> 01:49:22.700
Been exploring how five minute
a day respiration protocols

01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:24.280
can alleviate stress.

01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:26.830
And while those data
are not yet published,

01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:28.620
they are at the stage
where I'm comfortable

01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:29.620
talking about them.

01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:32.190
And we are seeing some very impressive

01:49:32.190 --> 01:49:34.610
and significant effects
on stress reduction

01:49:34.610 --> 01:49:38.110
not just from respiration
protocols that allow people

01:49:38.110 --> 01:49:41.510
to calm themselves but
also respiration protocols

01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:43.300
that bring people into a heightened state

01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:47.143
of autonomic sympathetic
arousal, AKA stress.

01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:50.540
As my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,

01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:53.790
he's an MD psychiatrist and PhD.

01:49:53.790 --> 01:49:58.790
Likes to say, "When it comes
to trauma, anxiety and PTSD,

01:49:59.670 --> 01:50:02.010
and the treatment of
trauma, anxiety, and PTSD,

01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:06.350
it's not just the state that
you are in or that you go into.

01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:09.740
It's how you got there and
whether or not you had anything

01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:10.880
to do with it."

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:12.810
And this brings us right back to those

01:50:12.810 --> 01:50:15.080
top-down mechanisms and the narrative

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:17.380
around what we are
experiencing internally.

01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:20.370
So let's zoom out and I'll
explain how this works

01:50:20.370 --> 01:50:21.910
and what to do about it.

01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:24.180
We have this brain structure
called the insular.

01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:25.720
We talked about the
insular a few minutes ago.

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.150
The insular is calibrating
how we feel internally

01:50:29.150 --> 01:50:31.290
versus what's going on externally.

01:50:31.290 --> 01:50:34.240
It's involved in setting whether or not

01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:37.963
what we are feeling is appropriate
given what's happening.

01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:42.620
We have a system that can
generate threat responses.

01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:45.740
And in the case of trauma,
PTSD, and extreme stress,

01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:47.970
chronic stress, that system gets ramped up

01:50:47.970 --> 01:50:50.270
so that it takes very little,
maybe even just a memory

01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:53.577
or maybe even an association
that we're not even aware of,

01:50:53.577 --> 01:50:56.270
our location trigger something,
we're not even aware of it.

01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:59.260
And we start experiencing
that symptomology.

01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:01.170
How do we recalibrate the system?

01:51:01.170 --> 01:51:03.530
Well, most of the approaches
that are out there

01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:05.270
involving drug treatments,

01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:09.590
typical drug treatments would
involve suppressing the level

01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:11.250
of internal arousal.

01:51:11.250 --> 01:51:12.900
Just trying to bring that down.

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:14.910
Now, some of those drug treatments work.

01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:16.400
But oftentimes they don't.

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:18.380
And if you think about it,

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:20.420
it's probably not
surprising that they don't

01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:22.200
because by taking a drug

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:26.090
that just lowers your anxiety overall

01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:30.231
you're creating a different
sort of miscalibration

01:51:30.231 --> 01:51:31.580
of the system.

01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:34.500
So what we've been doing in human subjects

01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:38.440
is having them do either breathing
protocols that calm them,

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.180
and I'll explain what that is in a moment,

01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:42.190
or doing breathing protocols that increase

01:51:42.190 --> 01:51:44.080
their level of autonomic arousal

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:47.140
and seeing how that impacts their response

01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.470
to stress overall not just
during that particular

01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:50.510
breathing protocol.

01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:53.030
So the calming protocol that we use

01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:55.140
involves these physiological size.

01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:57.470
I've talked about these
previously on the podcast

01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:59.860
and elsewhere but if you
just need a reminder,

01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:01.110
if you haven't heard about it.

01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:03.200
There's a pattern of breathing
that we all do in sleep.

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:05.010
When our carbon dioxide
levels in our bloodstream

01:52:05.010 --> 01:52:05.843
get too high.

01:52:05.843 --> 01:52:07.930
And we do this when we get claustrophobic,

01:52:07.930 --> 01:52:09.090
meaning we do it reflexively.

01:52:09.090 --> 01:52:10.680
And that's a double
inhale through the nose

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.120
followed by a long exhale.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:13.005
So it's,

01:52:13.005 --> 01:52:14.460
[Andrew breathing]

01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:16.460
And yes, the inhales
should be through the nose

01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:18.070
and yes, the exhales should be done

01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:19.230
through the mouth, ideally.

01:52:19.230 --> 01:52:22.270
So it's a big filling of the
lungs through two breaths

01:52:22.270 --> 01:52:23.610
back to back.

01:52:23.610 --> 01:52:24.443
Inhales.

01:52:24.443 --> 01:52:25.570
[Andrew breathing]

01:52:25.570 --> 01:52:27.080
Even if you could only
sneak in a little air

01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:28.290
on that second one,

01:52:28.290 --> 01:52:29.800
no talking to if you're
going to do it right.

01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:30.740
And then a long exhale,

01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:33.000
which allows you to offload
a lot of carbon dioxide

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:33.880
in the exhale.

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:37.720
And we have people doing that in real time

01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:38.980
anytime they experienced stress

01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:41.120
but the particular breathing protocol

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:42.920
that we've been giving human subjects

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:45.610
is for them to do the repeated...

01:52:45.610 --> 01:52:46.660
What we call cyclic sign.

01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:49.380
So double inhale, exhale,
double inhale, exhale,

01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:51.740
double inhale, exhale
repeatedly for five minutes.

01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:53.470
Which is actually a pretty
long time to repeat that.

01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:56.420
But you can do it pretty
slowly and people report

01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:58.800
and the data point to the
fact that it's very calming.

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:01.100
People feel more relaxed afterwards

01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:04.690
and that relaxation wicks
out into other aspects

01:53:04.690 --> 01:53:05.523
of their life.

01:53:05.523 --> 01:53:08.340
Now, we did not look at stress
and trauma in that condition.

01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:10.270
We also have another
condition where people do

01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:12.230
what's called cyclic hyperventilation,

01:53:12.230 --> 01:53:14.550
which is very different and
creates a very different

01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:19.010
internal state and is somewhat stressful.

01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:21.210
It's five minutes a day of stress

01:53:21.210 --> 01:53:23.860
much like the study that I just described.

01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:26.603
And involves basically doing this,

01:53:26.603 --> 01:53:29.900
what I'll do in a moment for five minutes

01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:31.350
which is hyperventilating.

01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:32.276
Which is,

01:53:32.276 --> 01:53:35.193
[Andrew breathing]

01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:38.840
But not continuously for the five minutes

01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:40.630
because many people would pass out

01:53:40.630 --> 01:53:42.320
or feel extremely uncomfortable.

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:44.840
It involves inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale,

01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:47.450
very deep inhale through the
nose, exhale through the mouth.

01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:51.100
And then every 25 or 30 breaths
or so doing a full exhale

01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:53.050
and holding one's breath, lungs empty

01:53:53.050 --> 01:53:56.870
for about 25, maybe 30,
maybe even 60 seconds.

01:53:56.870 --> 01:54:00.040
And then continuing
until five minutes is up.

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.940
Subjects report and our
data indicate that people

01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:06.310
feel a heightened level
of autonomic arousal.

01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:07.850
In fact, I can feel it right now

01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:11.340
even from a very brief
cyclic hyperventilation about

01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:12.173
I just did.

01:54:12.173 --> 01:54:15.010
You feel a heating up, you feel a...

01:54:15.010 --> 01:54:17.180
Some people will perspire,
some people get wide-eyed,

01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:18.450
some people feel agitated.

01:54:18.450 --> 01:54:21.030
That's Adrenaline being
released into your system.

01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:23.220
Now I'm not suggesting
everyone run out and do this.

01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:25.290
And if you have a
predisposition to panic attack

01:54:25.290 --> 01:54:27.680
or anxiety attacks please
don't do this because

01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:28.900
it is very stimulating

01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:31.120
and can trigger those sorts of attacks.

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.790
But this five minute a day protocol

01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:37.730
of cyclic hyperventilation
does lead to big increases

01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:38.780
in autonomic arousal.

01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:42.070
So it's "Stressful" but to bring us back

01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:45.160
to my colleague, David Spiegel's quote.

01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:47.180
It really was him that said it, not me.

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.970
It's not just about the
state that you're in.

01:54:48.970 --> 01:54:51.930
It's about the state that
you're in plus how you got there

01:54:51.930 --> 01:54:55.530
and whether or not you
directed entry into that state.

01:54:55.530 --> 01:55:00.530
And that point one directs
their own entry into a state

01:55:00.690 --> 01:55:03.160
deliberately is really key.

01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:08.150
And I think has an important
implications for whether or not

01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:11.050
their stress relief and fear
relief and trauma relief

01:55:11.050 --> 01:55:13.000
from bringing oneself into a state

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.610
of increased autonomic arousal.

01:55:14.610 --> 01:55:15.460
Why?

01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:19.470
Because of the way that that
fear and trauma circuitry

01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:20.303
is organized.

01:55:20.303 --> 01:55:21.850
If you recall, it's got these components

01:55:21.850 --> 01:55:24.010
of how external events can trigger

01:55:24.010 --> 01:55:26.320
an internal stress
response and fear response

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:27.520
and trauma response.

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:30.930
But there's that top-down
prefrontal component

01:55:30.930 --> 01:55:35.930
that can inhibit certain
aspects of that fear

01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:37.990
and threat circuitry.

01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:39.840
Now, earlier we were talking about

01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:44.000
that prefrontal circuit being
engaged through narrative,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.670
through self-directed
deliberate narrative.

01:55:46.670 --> 01:55:50.010
It's the person deliberately
retelling the story?

01:55:50.010 --> 01:55:53.430
Here we're talking about
a deliberate reactivation

01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:55.830
of the sensations in the body.

01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:58.140
So where I think this is all going,

01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:00.457
meaning where my laboratory
and the Spiegel laboratory

01:56:00.457 --> 01:56:03.430
and other laboratories
out there are taking this.

01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:08.220
Is you can imagine a very
brief five minutes a day,

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:10.000
two weeks was the time that they did this

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.860
for five minutes a day for two weeks.

01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:14.180
Intervention in which people,

01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:16.610
with the support of a
clinician we would hope,

01:56:16.610 --> 01:56:19.850
would deliberately induce
a physiological state

01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:21.730
that's very stressful, right?

01:56:21.730 --> 01:56:23.580
Not shying away from the stress response

01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:26.900
but increasing their own
stress response deliberately.

01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:30.920
And maybe in conjunction
with recounting the traumatic

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:33.370
or fearful circumstance.

01:56:33.370 --> 01:56:35.000
This is far and away different

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.800
than the kind of state of mind and body

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:38.020
that would come about

01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:41.400
in a Ketamine-assisted trauma
induced psychotherapy session,

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:45.950
or a MDMA-assisted trauma
psychotherapy session.

01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:50.530
Or in a purely narrative
based psychotherapy session

01:56:50.530 --> 01:56:53.540
aimed at alleviating fear or trauma.

01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:55.910
The reason I like these sorts
of interventions is that,

01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:58.870
A, they are very low cost
or even zero cost, right?

01:56:58.870 --> 01:57:02.950
One you could imagine
doing this while journaling

01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:06.090
or while recounting a
particular experience.

01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:08.840
Again, they're very
compact five minutes a day

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:11.240
for two weeks is what was done

01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:12.420
in this particular mouse study.

01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:14.130
We don't know if that translates directly

01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:15.560
to the human study or not.

01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.640
What was interesting is that if they use

01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:21.970
the longer daily bouts of
stress, like 15 minutes a day,

01:57:21.970 --> 01:57:24.770
that actually exacerbated the trauma

01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:27.020
and exacerbated the fear.

01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:29.260
So one has to be very careful.

01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:32.530
Stress and deliberate entry into stress

01:57:32.530 --> 01:57:35.010
and self stressing are very potent tools.

01:57:35.010 --> 01:57:38.150
They're very sharp blades
that it does appear

01:57:38.150 --> 01:57:43.020
or it's likely can help
alleviate trauma and fear.

01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:45.090
But how long to do this?

01:57:45.090 --> 01:57:46.630
Exactly what the protocol should be

01:57:46.630 --> 01:57:49.490
is still something that
needs to be cultivated.

01:57:49.490 --> 01:57:51.160
I know there are going to
be people out there that

01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:53.360
that nonetheless are going
to want to experiment

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.310
with some of this.

01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:57.650
I will say that I do not think it matters

01:57:57.650 --> 01:58:00.890
how one gets into that stressed state

01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:03.640
provided it as self-directed

01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:07.920
and that therefore could be cold shower.

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:09.040
It could be ice bath.

01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:12.380
It could be anything
that induces an acute,

01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:17.380
meaning a sudden onset of
Adrenaline and is self-directed

01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:19.600
that's really the key feature here.

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.770
So I'm very excited about these data

01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:23.350
both the five minute intervention data

01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:24.600
from the animal study.

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:26.470
The work that's ongoing in my laboratory

01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:27.990
and Dr. Spiegel's laboratory,

01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:30.360
and the work that's being
done on the insular.

01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:32.390
Because I think what
we're starting to see now

01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:36.190
is a picture of fear and trauma and PTSD

01:58:36.190 --> 01:58:38.450
that has the sensory component,

01:58:38.450 --> 01:58:40.130
what's happening in the world around us.

01:58:40.130 --> 01:58:42.820
This internal interoceptive component,

01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:44.500
how appropriate are the signals

01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:45.610
that are occurring in my body?

01:58:45.610 --> 01:58:46.560
I mean, let's face it.

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.250
If you almost get hit by
a car and your heart rate

01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:50.430
is 140 beats per second.

01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:52.223
And that lasts for a little
while and you're stressed out,

01:58:52.223 --> 01:58:55.070
you don't get the best night's
sleep, that's pretty normal.

01:58:55.070 --> 01:58:56.820
That means you have a healthy fear system.

01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:59.830
If that persists and you're
dealing with a lot of issues

01:58:59.830 --> 01:59:02.310
a week later, six weeks
later, two years later.

01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:06.080
Then it's moved into the
realm of trauma and PTSD.

01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:09.280
So we need to always
be taking into account

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:11.080
the different components of the circuitry.

01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:14.310
I do think that deliberate
self-directed entry

01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:15.820
into these short bouts of stress

01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:17.480
is a very promising approach.

01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:20.210
And it's one that if people
are going to experiment

01:59:20.210 --> 01:59:22.420
I just again, want to
caution people with anxiety

01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:25.380
or panic disorders be very
cautious, probably don't do it.

01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:28.260
Ideally you would do this
in conjunction with support

01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:29.610
from a clinician.

01:59:29.610 --> 01:59:31.700
But I'm also aware that there
are a lot of people out there

01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:33.160
that are dealing with trauma

01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:36.920
and dealing with post-traumatic
stress of various kinds.

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:39.680
And that they're desperate for various

01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:42.420
self directed intervention approaches.

01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:45.380
So just very briefly, I want to
touch on some of the lifestyle

01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:48.960
and supplementation factors
that can impact things

01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:51.973
like fear and trauma and
getting over fear and trauma.

01:59:53.070 --> 01:59:55.150
To make a long story short.

01:59:55.150 --> 01:59:58.450
There are many things that
we all can and should do

01:59:58.450 --> 02:00:01.120
to support our overall
mental and physical health.

02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:03.110
And these are the foundational elements

02:00:03.110 --> 02:00:04.730
of quality nutrition.

02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:06.610
What that means to you?

02:00:06.610 --> 02:00:08.950
Quality sleep on a regular basis,

02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:10.480
ample sleep on a regular basis.

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:13.610
We have an episode on how
to master sleep in bed.

02:00:13.610 --> 02:00:16.350
We have four episodes that
you can go to hubermanlab.com

02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:17.610
or elsewhere and scroll down

02:00:17.610 --> 02:00:21.560
and you can find those episodes
in order to get your sleep

02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.620
really dialed in as they say.

02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:27.690
If you're sleeping regularly
and for sufficient duration,

02:00:27.690 --> 02:00:30.900
all of the systems of your fear circuitry

02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:32.780
are going to function better.

02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:34.960
Mainly because the
autonomic nervous system

02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:36.970
becomes very dysregulated

02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:41.333
when we are not getting good
sleep on a regular basis.

02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:45.700
Dysregulated means that out of nowhere

02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:47.750
we can have a higher propensity

02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:49.740
to have sympathetic activation

02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:52.060
or we can feel really tired and wired.

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:54.450
That seesaw that I described
earlier of alertness

02:00:54.450 --> 02:00:57.450
and calmness of sympathetic
and parasympathetic.

02:00:57.450 --> 02:00:59.890
In that analogy we can imagine that seesaw

02:00:59.890 --> 02:01:03.040
has a hinge and that hinge
can neither be too tight

02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.270
nor too loose.

02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:05.103
If it's too tight,

02:01:05.103 --> 02:01:08.230
you can get locked into
chronic activation of alertness

02:01:08.230 --> 02:01:09.740
or chronic fatigue.

02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:11.960
If it's too loose, you're
bouncing all over the place

02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:13.670
and you might be [indistinct]
tired and wired one moment

02:01:13.670 --> 02:01:16.540
and then really hyper alert.

02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:20.310
Sleep resets that balance
and resets that hinge

02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:22.590
to the appropriate tightness, if you will.

02:01:22.590 --> 02:01:25.170
So that all these circuits

02:01:25.170 --> 02:01:27.550
and not just the circuits related to fear

02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:29.350
but also the circuits
related to cognition,

02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:31.870
clear thinking to be able to spell out

02:01:31.870 --> 02:01:33.870
very clear detailed narratives,

02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:35.390
to feel like you are in control.

02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:38.170
You are deliberately bringing
yourself into these protocols

02:01:38.170 --> 02:01:39.430
if that's what you intend to use.

02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:41.220
All of that functions much better

02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:42.890
when you're sleeping well and eating well.

02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:44.500
We talked about social connection.

02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:48.800
Those are all indirect
supports of trauma relief

02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:51.430
and of getting over fear
but they are essentia, okay?

02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:53.990
I think of them sort of like the tide.

02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:56.790
When the tide is high enough
a boat can leave harbor.

02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:58.960
And if the tide is not high enough,

02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:01.550
then that boat is going
to be stranded on shore.

02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:02.970
And in this analogy,

02:02:02.970 --> 02:02:05.600
the boat stranded on shore is your attempt

02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:08.390
or anybody's attempt to try
and work through something.

02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:10.170
Very hard to do when we're sleep deprived,

02:02:10.170 --> 02:02:13.160
very hard to do when we're not fed enough

02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:15.570
or fed the proper foods for you.

02:02:15.570 --> 02:02:17.470
And that's a highly individual thing.

02:02:17.470 --> 02:02:19.940
And social connection as
we talked about earlier,

02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:23.120
creates a general sense
of support for the ability

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:24.020
to move through things.

02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:26.030
But also chemical support at the level

02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:27.480
of suppressing Tachykinin, okay?

02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:29.610
So those foundational
elements are absolutely key,

02:02:29.610 --> 02:02:31.220
but they are indirect.

02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:33.990
I just want to briefly
mention a few of the things

02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:36.920
that some people find great benefit from

02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:41.670
in the supplementation realm
as it relates to anxiety,

02:02:41.670 --> 02:02:44.300
stress, fear and PTSD.

02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:45.840
But I want to point out that again,

02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:48.490
these are somewhat
indirect in their support

02:02:48.490 --> 02:02:53.200
and most of them focus on
reducing anxiety overall.

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:55.650
The two that I want to focus
on are two that I've never

02:02:55.650 --> 02:02:58.170
talked about on this podcast before

02:02:58.170 --> 02:03:00.310
because I've done
podcasts before on stress

02:03:00.310 --> 02:03:02.630
and managing stress in
the kind of shorter term.

02:03:02.630 --> 02:03:05.110
So we've talked about Ashwagandha
in a previous podcast,

02:03:05.110 --> 02:03:08.150
check out the podcast on stress,

02:03:08.150 --> 02:03:11.110
if you're interested in
how that might be relevant

02:03:11.110 --> 02:03:12.470
as well as other tools.

02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:15.670
But the two are interesting ones.

02:03:15.670 --> 02:03:18.520
The first one is Saffron of all things.

02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:21.580
But there are 12 studies,
believe it or not.

02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:25.610
That orally ingested
Saffron at 30 milligrams

02:03:25.610 --> 02:03:28.750
seems to be a reliable
dose for reducing anxiety

02:03:28.750 --> 02:03:30.410
on the standard inventories.

02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:32.160
The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale,

02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:33.300
for those of you that want to know.

02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:34.730
And these are significant effects.

02:03:34.730 --> 02:03:38.310
And these were carried out in
both male and female subjects.

02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:40.680
Here I'm only referring to human studies.

02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:42.530
Several of these were
double-blind studies.

02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:46.450
There's a meta analysis
of the positive effects.

02:03:46.450 --> 02:03:49.280
Meaning anxiolytic affects,

02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:53.280
anxiety reducing effects that
is of things like Saffron.

02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:54.560
Definitely have to check with your doctor

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:55.500
and make sure it's right for you.

02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:58.260
But they're fairly impressive effects

02:03:58.260 --> 02:03:59.790
when you really think about it

02:03:59.790 --> 02:04:02.560
given that these are legal
over the counter substances.

02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.130
Again, check with a doctor.

02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:06.170
The other one is a Inositol.

02:04:07.010 --> 02:04:11.760
Inositol has been shown to
create a very notable decrease

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:13.440
in anxiety symptoms.

02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:17.480
It's a fairly high dose that's
used but believe it or not,

02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:19.760
the potency of this
effect is on par with many

02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:21.670
of the prescription antidepressants.

02:04:21.670 --> 02:04:23.680
That's pretty impressive.

02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:25.960
These studies again are
double-blind studies

02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:29.680
that all showed decreases in anxiety.

02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:31.900
These were done in males and females.

02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:33.240
The age range is very broad,

02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:35.970
which is great 18 all the way up to 64

02:04:35.970 --> 02:04:37.420
across the studies that I at.

02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:40.540
One of the more important things is that

02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:44.160
the dosages are quite
high 18 grams of Inositol

02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:45.600
taken for a full month.

02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:48.710
And it does take some
time for these symptoms

02:04:48.710 --> 02:04:52.240
of anxiety to be improved.

02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:55.240
The low dose range was
about 12 grams of Inositol,

02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:58.940
so as high as 18 as low as 12 grams.

02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:01.390
But then again, pretty impressive results

02:05:01.390 --> 02:05:03.576
considering that these
are over the counter

02:05:03.576 --> 02:05:05.570
supplement compounds.

02:05:05.570 --> 02:05:07.740
There's even some evidence,
I should just mention

02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:10.140
that the Inositol is
also used for things like

02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:11.940
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:14.630
We will do a full episode
on OCD in the future,

02:05:14.630 --> 02:05:16.160
you can count on that.

02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:18.840
But in the meantime, Inositol does seem

02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:22.560
to have some positive effects on anxiety.

02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:26.200
And therefore it might
provide a kind of supportive

02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:28.410
indirect effect for people that are trying

02:05:28.410 --> 02:05:31.330
to work through trauma and PTSD.

02:05:31.330 --> 02:05:32.870
Now, the question is
when would you take it?

02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:36.220
Well, by the logic of
what we spelled out today,

02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:39.930
you probably would not want
to take it during a session

02:05:39.930 --> 02:05:43.690
or prior to a session where
you were trying to amplify

02:05:43.690 --> 02:05:45.750
the intensity of an
experience and the recounting

02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:48.750
of an experience in efforts to eventually

02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:50.450
extinguish that experience, right?

02:05:50.450 --> 02:05:53.230
Because if you put a drug
or a compound of any kind

02:05:53.230 --> 02:05:56.220
prescription drug or
supplement or any kind

02:05:56.220 --> 02:06:00.450
into your system you are
essentially short-circuiting

02:06:00.450 --> 02:06:04.010
the extinguishing effect, right?

02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:06.430
So you could imagine doing
this outside of that session

02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:07.990
as a way to kind of bring your system

02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:09.830
back to baseline, perhaps.

02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:11.280
So if you're going to
use these sorts of things

02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:12.870
you want to think about them logically.

02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:14.830
And this also really
points to the fact that

02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:16.410
many of the things that
people are doing out there

02:06:16.410 --> 02:06:18.510
to self-medicate over use of alcohol

02:06:18.510 --> 02:06:20.870
or other substances to
try and calm themselves

02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:23.060
because they have fear, anxiety and PTSD

02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:27.080
are actually driving that
fear, anxiety and PTSD

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:28.100
deeper into their system.

02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:30.380
Or at least is not allowing
it to relieve itself

02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:33.330
through any attempts to recount or replay

02:06:33.330 --> 02:06:35.310
and using these top-down
narrative circuits

02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:36.570
or other approaches.

02:06:36.570 --> 02:06:38.230
And the last compound I want to mention

02:06:38.230 --> 02:06:39.890
is a particularly interesting one,

02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:42.300
because it's neither an anxiolytic,

02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:45.120
nor is it something that increases

02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:47.530
overall levels of stress and alertness.

02:06:47.530 --> 02:06:52.530
But it has some kind of MDMA
ish light contour to it.

02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:56.010
It does not produce as far as we know,

02:06:56.010 --> 02:06:59.890
the same mental effects or
physical effects as MDMA

02:06:59.890 --> 02:07:02.090
by any stretch but that's...

02:07:02.090 --> 02:07:04.860
The substance I'm referring
to rather is Kava.

02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:09.860
Kava has been shown in eight
studies to have a very potent

02:07:10.070 --> 02:07:11.720
effect on reducing anxiety.

02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:15.610
But what's interesting about
kava is that kava functions

02:07:15.610 --> 02:07:17.160
by increasing GABA,

02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:19.020
this inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the brain.

02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:21.940
Remember GABA is the
inhibitory neurotransmitter

02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:24.890
that is used, that's
employed by the very neurons

02:07:24.890 --> 02:07:28.210
in the prefrontal cortex
that serve to inhibit

02:07:28.210 --> 02:07:31.020
the threat reflex.

02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:32.910
So it seems to increase GABA,

02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:35.510
but it also increases Dopamine.

02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:37.960
And that's a somewhat unusual compound.

02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:40.510
I'm not aware of many compounds
that simultaneously increase

02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:42.510
GABA and increase Dopamine.

02:07:42.510 --> 02:07:45.010
And as you recall, that
threat reflex has outputs

02:07:45.010 --> 02:07:47.190
that tap into the Dopamine system.

02:07:47.190 --> 02:07:50.650
Now that's a big leap
to go from a compound

02:07:50.650 --> 02:07:52.030
that increases GABA and Dopamine

02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:54.460
and look at a circuit spelled out on paper

02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:55.293
in front of us and say,

02:07:55.293 --> 02:07:57.170
"Oh, there's GABA and
Dopamine in this circuit

02:07:57.170 --> 02:07:59.300
and therefore this is a
good compound to take."

02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:02.380
But the effects of Kava in human studies

02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:06.270
are pretty interesting
as it relates to anxiety,

02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:08.253
stress, PTSD and fear.

02:08:09.148 --> 02:08:10.580
I'm not going to summarize
all of these because

02:08:10.580 --> 02:08:13.540
there are eight studies that I'm aware of.

02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:14.520
But I'll just mention, again,

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:15.760
these are double blind studies.

02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:17.260
So the trial design is solid.

02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:20.160
The age ranges are anywhere from 18 to 64

02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:21.680
which is a nice broad age range.

02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:26.003
The number of subjects is
quite high both men and women.

02:08:26.970 --> 02:08:31.970
No signs of hepatotoxic signal
so meaning liver toxicity,

02:08:32.210 --> 02:08:34.350
although of course,
check with your doctor.

02:08:34.350 --> 02:08:36.880
But what was interesting
is that after a period

02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:38.890
of about three weeks of treatment

02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:42.420
with anywhere from 150 milligrams

02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:46.670
of what are called active
kava lactones, okay?

02:08:46.670 --> 02:08:49.160
So there are dosages
that relate to that kava.

02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:51.140
So a hundred milligrams of extract of Kava

02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:53.980
is a kind of a reasonable
typical dose in these studies.

02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:58.290
But that spells out to a
certain amount of Kava lactone.

02:08:58.290 --> 02:09:00.450
So you have to kind of boil down

02:09:00.450 --> 02:09:03.150
to what is the appropriate dosage.

02:09:03.150 --> 02:09:04.970
And it turns out it's extremely broad.

02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:06.680
You'll see evidence of 50 milligrams,

02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:07.753
you'll see evidence of 300 milligrams,

02:09:07.753 --> 02:09:09.780
is kind of all over the place.

02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:12.770
But each of these studies
alone and together

02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:15.770
point to the fact that
Kava does seem to produce

02:09:15.770 --> 02:09:20.770
a very potent anxiolytic and
general kind of improvement

02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:26.070
in depressive symptoms and
reduction in generalized anxiety

02:09:26.070 --> 02:09:26.940
across the board.

02:09:26.940 --> 02:09:28.220
So it's an interesting compound.

02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:30.320
I've never actually tried
any of the compounds

02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:31.500
I just mentioned.

02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:33.463
Kava, Saffron or Inositol.

02:09:35.710 --> 02:09:37.790
So I can't report on them personally.

02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:40.770
I just know that a number
of listeners of this podcast

02:09:40.770 --> 02:09:42.500
are interested in supplements

02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:45.830
and legal over the counter
approaches to their biology

02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:46.800
and psychology.

02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:48.260
And so that's why I mentioned them.

02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:49.700
Those were the three for which I found

02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:51.150
the most convincing evidence

02:09:51.150 --> 02:09:53.230
and the largest bulk of evidence.

02:09:53.230 --> 02:09:54.810
So if you're interested in exploring those

02:09:54.810 --> 02:09:58.670
proceed with caution but they
do seem quite interesting.

02:09:58.670 --> 02:10:01.290
So today we've reviewed a
large amount of information

02:10:01.290 --> 02:10:05.070
about the biology of pathways
in the brain and body

02:10:05.070 --> 02:10:06.780
that underlie the fear response.

02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:09.490
And they give rise to chronic fear

02:10:09.490 --> 02:10:12.093
and in some cases to trauma and PTSD.

02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:16.150
We also touched on a large
variety of approaches

02:10:16.150 --> 02:10:19.640
to dealing with fear, trauma and PTSD

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.980
that currently exist in the
clinical landscape out there.

02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:26.160
I also touch on some
of the emerging themes,

02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:28.610
for instance, this short five minute a day

02:10:28.610 --> 02:10:32.660
deliberate self-directed
stress of any kind

02:10:32.660 --> 02:10:34.680
through respiration or other approaches

02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:36.070
of increasing Adrenaline.

02:10:36.070 --> 02:10:38.700
As an approach that might be viable,

02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:40.080
I should emphasize might,

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:42.920
be viable for enhancing the speed

02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:47.920
or the potency of
treatments to reduce fear

02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:49.830
or eliminate trauma.

02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:52.270
Most important I believe is to understand

02:10:52.270 --> 02:10:54.480
and really think about
the logical structure

02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:57.660
of the circuits that
underlie fear and PTSD.

02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:01.050
Because in doing that
each of us, all of us,

02:11:01.050 --> 02:11:03.260
can think about what sorts
of treatments and approaches

02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:05.170
make the most sense for them.

02:11:05.170 --> 02:11:06.940
I also hope that it will help people

02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:11.940
lean into certain practices
involving re-exposure,

02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:14.000
provided that's done in
a supportive environment.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.590
Re-exposure to a given traumatic event

02:11:16.590 --> 02:11:18.600
in an attempt to extinguish that.

02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:20.250
Obviously you want to do that safely,

02:11:20.250 --> 02:11:23.010
meaning psychologically
safely and physically safely.

02:11:23.010 --> 02:11:25.520
There are great practitioners out there

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:28.020
that can help you with that work.

02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:29.580
There are also a number
of people out there

02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:32.930
I am certain that are
carrying certain traumas

02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:35.250
or certain fears that they
would like to alleviate

02:11:35.250 --> 02:11:38.290
that are not in the
extreme clinical realm.

02:11:38.290 --> 02:11:40.700
And that's the reason why I
touched on a number of things

02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:42.630
including some self-directed practices

02:11:42.630 --> 02:11:46.290
that might be useful and
reasonable for them to explore.

02:11:46.290 --> 02:11:48.230
I realize we covered a
lot of information today.

sponsors that we mentioned

02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:16.680
at the beginning of this episode.

02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:18.810
That's a terrific way to support us.

02:12:18.810 --> 02:12:22.820
We also have a Patreon, it's
patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:24.550
And there you can support this podcast

02:12:24.550 --> 02:12:26.500
at any level that you like.

02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:27.880
On this podcast episode

02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:29.870
and in many previous podcast episodes,

02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:31.460
I describe supplements.

02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:33.300
While supplements aren't necessary

02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:35.130
and perhaps aren't right for everybody

02:12:35.130 --> 02:12:37.640
many people derive great
benefit from supplements.

02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:39.120
It is important however,

02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:40.370
that if you're going to use supplements

02:12:40.370 --> 02:12:42.020
that they be a very high quality

02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:44.590
and that you can trust that
the amounts of supplement

02:12:44.590 --> 02:12:46.020
listed on the supplement bottle

02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:47.810
are actually what's
contained in the bottle.

02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:50.430
That's a serious issue with a
lot of supplements out there.

02:12:50.430 --> 02:12:53.320
For that reason, we partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-E.

02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:55.670
Because Thorne has the
highest levels of stringency

02:12:55.670 --> 02:12:57.920
with respect to the quality
of their supplements

02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:00.710
and the amounts of the
supplements listed on the bottle

02:13:00.710 --> 02:13:02.790
are actually what's are
contained in the bottle.

02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:04.700
They've partnered with
all the major sports teams

02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:06.030
as well as the Mayo Clinic.

02:13:06.030 --> 02:13:08.840
So we have a very high degree
of trust with Thorne products.

02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:10.040
If you want to see the Thorne products

02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:12.827
that I take you can go
to Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

02:13:12.827 --> 02:13:16.130
.com/u/huberman.

02:13:16.130 --> 02:13:18.060
And there you can see the
supplements that I take.

02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:20.280
You can get 20% off any
of those supplements.

02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:22.930
And if you navigate deeper
into the Thorne site,

02:13:22.930 --> 02:13:26.590
through that portal,
thorne.com/u/huberman,

02:13:26.590 --> 02:13:29.640
you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements

02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:30.760
that Thorne makes.

02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:32.960
If you're not already
following Huberman Lab

02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.750
on Twitter and Instagram,

02:13:34.750 --> 02:13:37.050
there I do short neuroscience tutorials.

02:13:37.050 --> 02:13:39.930
I offer a lot of tools
oftentimes that don't overlap

02:13:39.930 --> 02:13:41.770
with the content of the podcast.

02:13:41.770 --> 02:13:43.390
And last but not least,

02:13:43.390 --> 02:13:44.917
thank you for your interest in science.

02:13:44.917 --> 02:13:47.500
